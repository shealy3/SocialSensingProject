Cybertruck will obviously be the most badass police vehicle. (However, until the production begins maybe buy Model 3. It's relatively cheaper than Model X and police is already using it.)https://cleantechnica.com/2020/01/05/police-department-adds-2020-tesla-model-3-explains-why/ …

[BREAKING] Tesla does NOT need to be done felling latest mid March! Mr Reschke (Leader in Parliament of the Greens): the rule does not apply to the Testa Forrest formally - it would be nice to be done by end of February latest mid March. But formally it’s not necessary!!! pic.twitter.com/rHKvdB1kdR

@ elonmusk please give the OPP a Cyber Truck to Test for a Year !!

Didnt realize Allah created Tesla. Crazy.

PSA: Be warned! Supercharging is going to be disabled soon to customers who have an outstanding balance with no credit card on file. Tesla is starting with very high balance customers first and working their way down the list. Don’t be caught without a card on file!

Cybertruck all day long. Best police vehicle ever

Woot woot! Congrats!

You are the man Ryan, and thanks @ elonmusk !!

Model 3 LR MSM that I put 17k miles on since July because I’m in love with the car. Own 6 shares, and plan to keep buying more every few weeks/months. Been following Tesla and Elon since 2013.

Thinks? They are definitely attacking Tesla. Because Tesla is killing them. Natural survival instinct is to spend millions to get the media to blow up every little bit of bad news against the company and writing few to non positive articles

I fully support electric vehicles and carpooling. I can't wait to buy my first Tesla, but please be aware they are not 0% emission. Energy is required to mine lithium, ore and processing of plastic. Not to mention transportation of those materials. Those still produce emissions.

Dyson also realising that while EV tech may be still in its infancy the expertise required to compete is held by very mature automotive companies. And they have not been wasting the last 7yrs since Tesla launched the Model S, but particularly the last 4yrs & impact of Dieselgate.

Imagine a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. That’s the same thing with owning Tesla and not having autopilot.

Cancellation of Dyson car shows courage. Puts Tesla’s achievements into perspective, but also underlines the extent to which its huge challenges are not unique to Musk’s vision but common to anyone who thinks that eliminating the ICE makes volume car design & prod somehow easier

News: @ Tesla delivers 1,000 ventilators to the state of California.

California'S Newsom Says That Tesla'S Elon Musk Told Him That More Than 1,000 Ventilators Were Delivered To Los Angeles On Monday

does it matter? if @ Tesla can do either or both, doesn't it help with the problem at hand?

There was even a Bloomberg article that didn’t mention Tesla until all the way at the bottom, but Ford and GM were at the top. EV’s have different A/C due to no ICE engine, and SpaceX also makes life support systems. Who has more expertise? How was that not fake news.

Holy crap that was fast! Once this is over, if I'm still alive, I'm going to be buying a Tesla! Thank you Elon Musk!! # COVID19 # ventilators

California Gov. Gavin Newsom with some praise for Tesla CEO Elon Musk: "Elon Musk: How about this? I told you a few days ago that he was likely to have 1,000 ventilators this week. They've arrived in Los Angeles. ... It's a heroic effort."
