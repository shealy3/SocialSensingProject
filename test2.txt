In our country, Indonesia, there's a vendor that have adopted this since a half year ago. But we're agree @ Tesla should learn from @ WeAreGogoro who sell without battery, because it makes the unit become less competitive to fossil-fuel ones. Hope @ Tesla won't be too late for this!

This shows exactly why this feature is stupid. It's like asking to hike your insurance rate. Also, if the car moved that slow in a busy parking lot, it's going to get honked and beeped at and an accident waiting to happen.

You can take control of a Tesla at any time in milliseconds if your hands are on the wheel like they're supposed to be.

Hah! Tesla has people scouring the Internet to troll those saying anything remotely negative about a union busting company that launches cars that cost more than most make a year into space. Considering they were just begging for money, they could probably spend it better.

This may sound odd, but initially this morning i did not see "come to me" on home screen. I did use the smart summon feature as a test this morning and this afternoon i noticed "come to me" on Home screen. Again, I don't really know how or why.

Great idea to send these videos to tv stations. Let them warn their views of these dangerous driverless Tesla's. Irresponsible owners playing with an untested Smart Summons

Driving requires interpreting and anticipating the intentions of other humans. Thus, it requires full Theory of Mind. Autonomous driving will happen after environments without humans (mines, warehouses, factories) are 100% automated. We're not even close.

they did not prevent anyone from unionizing. That is a bald faced lie. The union won;t hold a vote because they KNOW they would lose ... the workers in the Freemont factory WERE Union members back in the day & the Union ABANDONED them ... Tesla SAVED their jobs and they remember

I’ve just seen more and more people use V2X and when I have used V2G in the past as the “generic term” - lots of people will correct me an say you mean “V2H” or whatever - so I’ve decided to use V2X when I mean more than one and be specific otherwise - Twitter requires perfection

That happened to me also. The “come to me” and “vent windows” didn’t show up on my iPhone Tesla app even though I got the update. It randomly popped up on my app about 1-2 days later. Hope it happens to you too.

It will be fine. They will also keep updating I am sure

mustang ev sounds great for the market, if they can only get over the old management techniques and build a startup without union and attract best of union folks who sees it better when it’s done right. Tesla is regarded every year as one of the best places to work, no union # EVs

I approve of this idea!

Okay the latest update 2019.32.11 improved # Tesla # V10 autopilot a ton. Must’ve been bug fixes . Smart Summon still isn’t what I expected but oh well lol

Im not worried about Tesla. They hurl $90k cars into space so they can fall on us one day, and prevented their employees from unionizing, which is illegal here. Keep supporting those harming working people while you try to shame progressives. I’m sure it won’t reflect poorly.

Would Tesla insurance cover something like this if it was the software's fault?

No, I used V2X intentionally - it represents V2G (grid), V2H (home) and V2B (building) - it is easier than spelling all 3

First I hear of this Android app version would be appreciated. Apkmomk is showing latest as 381

https://www.tesla.com/support/software-version-10-0 …. Note the last paragraph in the Smart Summon section

Hello, there is your unroll: Thread by @ ElonBachman: "1\ Going to scream into the void a little on the subject of @ tesla "Smart Summon" Yes, Summon is inept. Yes, the fanboys […]" https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1178402298982277121.html … See you soon.

Mine didn’t pop up in the app until I went into the summon and controls menu. Then when I went back to the main screen it was there. Maybe try that?

Kids born today won’t know how to drive because cars will be completely driving themselves by the time they are old enough to drive.

It’s also insanity to argue with them and rebuke them and expect a different result

NoA is part of EAP & FSD & so is smart Summon. Hence my confusion.

So many new features in this update. This is the biggest software update in history, imho. (Thought I should fix that & clarify "Tesla software update," then thought again.) Of course bigger will be when FSD is implemented. But rolling in Netflix, YouTube & other updates is HUGE

All I know is tesla was 98% unresponsive to something very simple , I also see this as biggest complaint of others too. I sympathize for those who have major issues cause I know how rough something simple was. Love my car and there mission , just not their customer service

I have EAP, 2017 Mx without FSD chip. I have "come to me" I don't have a finger on rhyme or reason. Summon wasn't working so i realized i had to update the Tesla app.

What do you propose should happen to China and India, the two biggest polluters on earth? Good luck getting them to do anything. US is an easy target for idiots like you. What, you bought a Tesla so you think your saving the planet? You should give up your iPhone too.

I think it only comes up if there’s an accurate GPS reading on both you and the car.

You think a fancy Tesla would at least have the steering wheel on the correct side.

I told my mom I wanted a Tesla and Dusty said “you forget to charge your phone, your gonna forget to charge your car and stay stranded in the middle of nowhere” I hate him, but he has a point.

Had to use summon for the first time for real recently. Some douche decided to park real real close to me when there were a ton of parking spots around. You won’t use it often but is the most useful thing ever when you do. Can’t wait for V10 to roll out to me @ Tesla # tesla

Nope I use iPhone and that screen shot is from my friend who has an android. And she has FSD. Hence my conclusion like that.

The easy way for me would have been to go to the @ Tesla # SuperChargers. But I like to try other chargers as if I was not driving a @ Tesla, to assess if other # EV are a viable alternative to gas car, if you don’t have home charging. They are not... so far in my area

Yeah it's BS

Yeah, we are only at the start of the EV revolution. I expect it will take some time but the end result will be vehicles that are more reliable and last far longer than today's cars.

In staight line racing, every 10th of a second is a big difference. “Less than 1 second” is crazy when taken into context 5 seat practical family sedan versus a 2 seat cramped sports car built to go “fast”

0-60? Those cars ended with speeds of 120 mph+ in the video I showed you. Sure, a corvette would probably win from a 100 mph roll. But how often would you find the opportunity to do that on the street? I eat corvettes for lunch all the time at red lights

In 10 years, Tesla has gone from a one-car company to being compared with Porsche — here's why that's incredible pic.twitter.com/K4VQvL16FX

I was serious about wanting to go on a Nikola Tesla themed ghost hunt in New York. It might be fun! Doesn't have to be during NYCC. Maybe I'll be healthy enough to do it in a few years. I can do more than last year even if it's not as much as I could before my arm problems.

Like i said 0-60. After that the corvette was running it down. And if u need proof for that the vette had a better top speed. Therefore the tesla is only good for 0-60 after that it is trash. In a half mile or full mile race the vette would have run it down

Me too. I think in my case it was avoiding the public road it knows it can't drive on.

There's a bit more to Tesla drag races than most people think ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modn0qKRcp4 …

I like your argument, but it seems like Tesla is going to have to step things up to avoid being not at fault, but having accidents all the time

The problem is not the car. The chargers are extremely unreliable …. And that's out of control of Tesla

Eric I was providing a theoretical example for the situation in general to Paul for illustrative purposes My statement was seperate from this specific example of the Tesla, which did, in fact, yield its right of way in an attempt to avoid the collision by stopping.

The Achilles heel of non-Tesla EV’s. Our i3 is a b*tch to accomplish charging with the number of other drivers fighting for the few available working fast chargers (sometimes it works out fine, most of the time though :/)

But police departments stop the chase just after 100 mph for the safety of the public. That’s why it’s irrelevant

Also presumptive to say the Tesla did not properly yield. We have hours of YouTube showing how overly cautious the car be be. Even ES limited to 5mph currently. Given both videos it’s likelier the Tesla did not have enough time to react. The same as a human in that situation.

You made the claim that they’re “trash” after 60. That’s simply not true. Back your claim up with facts, I dare you And after 100 mph, you’ll see most if not all police chases are called off due to being a hazard to the public. They follow via aerial for safety

Do you have any proof that after 60 a Tesla is “trash”? It matches competition until after 100 mph, which in the context of a police chase would be irrelevant.

Is that how much it had cost you ready? $11.25? Or was that from a previous charge? I didn't think the price would show up for 3rd party chargers.

You don’t have to believe me. Many people have documented it on video. Look on YouTube. Teslas can sustain speeds of over 120 mph easily... after which the police department would call off the chase for being a hazard and follow via aerial surveillance regardless of gas/electric

Eso voy a hacer. No pierdo más tiempo aquí. Señor ejemplo

If only we had a government agency to look into Tesla's dangerous cars and fraud.

Does V10 include behaviour prediction in the neural net for autopilot? or is that coming in Q4

Ah I did mispeak, the 400hp is indeed the upgrade, but still, cheaper price to purchase ans will keep up with 95% of cars still

Tesla's awesome Five Man Acoustical Jam features their great version of Five Man Electrical Band's Signs and it became a #3 hit for Tesla! Listen to # MyRockandRollHeaven now on # BoomRadiohttp://station.voscast.com/5cf1797b01ee8/ pic.twitter.com/YnG7C34KY0

Det trengs litt oppklaring her. Bilproduksjon fører til CO2-utslipp, og her står elbiler i en særklasse mtp. høyt utslipp (batteriproduksjon). Avhengig av kjørelengde og batteripakke må en Tesla kjøre i 6-8-10 år før den går i gevinst med CO2 kontra en bensin eller dieselbil.

Yes! Obviously Tesla’s 0-60 times are very conservative. The Model S Plaid would have to run 9 seconds in the 1/4 for it to achieve such an amazing time around the Nurburgring. The production version will surprisingly be even faster according to Elon.

Returned from the first Tesla road trip, and even though some people and weather tried to convince me it was hard, the only hard part was traffic. 540 miles all electric and just a touch out of the way. Can't wait for Alex supercharger to open!

It is magical. I had a woman screaming in a parking lot that the car was rolling "whose car is this!" Panic in her voice. Wish I saved that one, I was in early access during that episode. After seeing me waiting for it she yelled "that is too cool! Is that Tesla?". Fun

@ elonmusk please gift me a Tesla Model X

Ah I see... like the £125,000 Tesla with the same satnav as a Chrysler ... difference is the Chrysler won’t catch fire

Just seen a Tesla driving up to its owner... pretty cool

Had a great time at the Tesla Festival celebrating tech and innovation! So many great booths, like the Energy Central booth. Thanks Cheryl & Victor for your neat electrical demonstations & a big thanks to the @ celtxrobotics for letting me control their robot # STEMpic.twitter.com/Tpgo9jK9Gw

Nice, smart . This could in the future allow a user profile to set that preference for a driver. I tend to drive a bit on the right hand side of the lane when driving next to a concrete divider. @ tesla ? What say you ?.

For the 5mm time, Tesla desperately wants the competition. They aren’t worried, they’re happy. https://apple.news/APyGztXvSNnWWerwr581P9g …

I always hated to use gps, even for long travels, I always wanted to drive to the location my own way. And when I got the Tesla, same thing but once NoA came out, even from work on a daily I’ll use the TN just to have NoA bc it’s a lot more superior over basic AP

If this function is in beta, it’s unsafe to use & it shouldn’t be publicly available. The 3 clearly had to emergency stop at the last second, that’s not normal driving behavior for a human. It should have detected the SUV and been slowing, not accelerating to the intersection.

Done

Tesla non ha inventato niente. Se le altre case non avevano prodotto prima è per via dei costi insostenibili e se producono ora è per evitare le multe dei governi.Tesla non ha mai chiuso 1 anno positivo, 1.1 miliardi di perdita in 6 mesi da gennaio, oltre 10 miliardi di debito.

And those SRBs that landed in the ocean cost more to refurbish than to build new ones. But boy did those refurbishments employ a lot of people, and wasn’t that the point?

Dude. You get full props for sharing this. While admittedly, not the best test, sharing this opens you and tesla to massive criticism. However, it will likely lead to their engineers making further improvement. Don't like where you tested it but give you two thumbs up for sharing

Almost certainly true, but the pods will be smaller in future and you won't need a touchscreen to call them.

Exactly. Which is why this is a pure gimmick feature to generate free marketing And no, I think that for all the mishaps & accidents Tesla still think that this will be a net positive for them

Thanks for confirming what we all know.

It’s to lower the stock price. Just like every other tweet. Any algorithm that searches for Tesla hashtags on twitter will see it and associate it with the negative words in the headline of the link. It’s a small nudge on the neural networks.

@ 28delayslater @ tesla_raj Is it me or the article brings up unrelated issues to the question of when to buy a Tesla?!? What is the official response from tesla it was owners fault for rust? Seeing several negative articles pop up on @ InsideEVs recently. What's up with that?

They aren't tired but they are frustrated as hell to start making personal attacks on Tesla supporters.

at least it’s number 1

This infuriates me ....and I drive a Tesla. Aarrgg!!!

Full left lock on in steering when going forward? Otherwise damage pattern seems weird.

This looks a little like certain companies were cherry-picked to fit a narrative. If you excluded the three outliers Google, Tesla and Zoom (perhaps even just Google and Zoom) the chart would be basically flat.

I’m listening to Crime Junkie podcast and then I went upstairs to put the clothes away and Tesla comes upstairs and says she’s scared and is pointing to the hallway and I’m ready to be murdered.

My guess is the can will be kicked down the road. Elon can threaten to shut SCTY down, but at the same time not paying the debt will severely impact his access to capital markets in general. Catch 22, easiest solution to just roll over (as in the past).

Don’t get why this is “news”. The Tesla ran low on battery and went to a supercharger to charge up. It didn’t completely “run out of juice”. It’s the same as if a regular car runs low on gas during pursuit, which isn’t uncommon.

Amen

Hope so too, but trying not to worry about quarterly data too much. Big picture!

And honestly, why havent you switched to a Tesla yet? Big yikes.

The Tesla actually had to pull out of pursuit to go to a charging station because it was getting low on battery, same as when a regular police car runs low on gas during a pursuit.

Look at the bright side. We get to put a face on the ignorant evil forces at play against innovation and our future. Might as well be toilet boy. Take solace in the fact that he's working for @ Tesla marketing at his own expense.

People ordering must click on your referral link and complete the order there. Your referral becomes integral part of the order and cannot be changed. Just giving the code to the staff at the Tesla shop does not give you the referral like it used to do a couple of years ago.

Yes they both have charismatic CEOs (or did) who bend the truth - & maybe more. BUT the business models are completely different. Tesla makes something people pay for, and that no one else makes like it. WeWork is a middleman for real estate that can be gotten elsewhere.

Plenty of new EVs coming out that are much cheaper than Teslas. There is little competition between the 2. As long as the electricity is cheaper than petrol/diesel on a per mile basis, it should be a reasonably attractive proposition for both parties. Also highly profitable .

Didn’t know it could do that. Sweet.

Aviam, senyora, una mica de comprensió lectora... Si només es prohibeix que circulin els cotxes vells, a qui es penalitza? A qui es pot comprar un totterreny o un Tesla o a qui no té prou diners per canviar de cotxe, és a dir, jubilats i classes treballadores?

The reason charging networks are yet to be financially sustainable is because Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market. And the supercharger network is very widespread, reliable and fast. Most non Tesla Charge points seem to be 50kw and all part of different networks.

That’s really unfortunate. You’re going to love the car so much but delivery has been known to have issues occasionally.

My take on autonomous driving: AI as in machine learning will be at most a tiny part of the solution. ML is opaque, hard to learn from, easy to mislead. Driving is priority based and constraints based. So I think most autonomous start-up took the wrong way.

Lots of news today making me wonder if we're back on a good timeline. Schwarzenegger lending Greta Thunberg a Tesla Model 3, and the news of a tennis ball black hole in our solar system

I have 210 mile range Tesla, got a 335 mile range Tesla 2.5 years later, for slightly lower payment (yes, I also got a great deal) - difference on road trips is HUGE - 300 vs 335 not so huge - 150 to 180 much more significant

Yea, and that's where I was going earlier with not working at all - or less anyways (aka Basic Income). To help subsidize living on less hours worked, those $$$ will have to come from somewhere!

Tesla was a mad genius. I read extensively about him while in school. He had a great conviction for making electricity cheap and affordable to the people. He's the father of electricity, unfortunately his dreams of achieving a world wireless electricity never came to life.

Tesla cars are big rc cars

No one has yet come up with a reliable for-profit charging network that covers long-distance travel. Subsidy of some sort may be required; Tesla subsides theirs through car sales and they experienced a backlash when they tried to raise rates to make it self-sufficient.

I just had someone use my referral code and I got my referral miles. The person also got their 2 years. If they use the referral link both get what they are owed.

Yep. Not the first time. I had a solar referral not get entered back when it was $750 and a chance for a powerwall. And boy did I try to get that fixed. Almost a year before I gave up. Plus my buddy didn’t get his 5 year extended warranty.

That I am sure it will, they mentioned the "pink"(IIRC) noise speaker to beep and warn. Also something about the lights…

Tesla ya deli denilen o günlerden, teslanin kurduğu sistemle teknolojinin bugünlere gelmesi.

Teslas hadden altijd al een standaard stekker (type 2, CCS). Daarmee kunnen Teslas wel laden bij openbare snelladers, maar andersom kan niet. Een Tesla geeft zn ID door aan de Supercharger en de kosten worden automatisch afgeschreven. Het betaalsysteem is dus bepalend.

I wouldn’t be surprised that when the tides turn on Tesla, Elon will find his fan base is less loyal than he realized. The back is going to be ugly as it all unwinds.

Yes, but they can keep it simple. I’ve already seen videos of people backing into Tesla’s on summon (even when summon has been fully stopped). Even if it’s a “you’re getting too close” kind of honk would be great.

I agree with this. If they have the capital to afford sth. There can also be ICE autonomous cars btw. Renewables are always better.

Stoopid comment from someone who seems to believe this is all a bad dream.

This is the wrong way to look at it. The supercharger network could be like any other network for other EVs and charged at a reasonable profit margin. This could help grow the supercharger network and generate much needed revenue. Remember that free supercharging costs Tesla $.

You know Nikola Tesla was from Sanna?

why buy a tesla if you’re still gonna drive 5 under the speed limit

And will gain confidence via biweekly OTA updates. Just like autopilot has. Not sure what you are looking for, but Tesla’s are obviously 6-10 yrs ahead of all competition in all categories. Maybe that’s why you don’t understand they are safety features being rolled out safely.

You know they have no integrity nor shame, and are just after scandalous, salacious stories to drive up advertising revenue. Why make a plea to the contrary when it will only fall on deaf ears?

And, they had 78 launches since their first. I was so not aware of that many, incredible. Must be a thing were we are all used to it so much that only the big ones, like man kinds biggest rocket launches get reported.

Don’t test this. The $ TLSAQ community tried this now for 2 days. Without succes.

Nice. I think the models are based on range. The range plus has 386km. Seems like a good amount.

La diferencia es que de esos problemas no se habla, porque hablar más de Tesla, "vende" más. De ahí que veas más problemas en Tesla que en otras marcas. No es que las demás marcas no tengan problemas, es que no hablan de ellos porque están ocupados en hablar de los de Tesla.

LO fucking L.

Funny the media is calling this the tesla killer, it is 3x expensive, slower, it’s “record” on the “ring” lasted about 5 days, only seats two adults and a couple kids.... new model S and roadster will destroy this car....

@ KSIOlajidebt @ miniminter that car wasn’t a Tesla or a Renault it was a Citroën

El año pasado también hice la misma pregunta en el SC y al ranger para el AP1 si era posible pagar para disponer en mi coche y me han dicho que mi modelo jamás tendría ap de Tesla.

I don't have a car at the moment, but within a year, I think I can buy a used car. If I want to get a hybrid, I will probably get a used Toyata Prius. I don't know how the Chevy Volt or the Nissan Leaf are in terms of resale. And a Tesla costs more than my yearly budget.

1\ Going to scream into the void a little on the subject of @ tesla "Smart Summon" Yes, Summon is inept. Yes, the fanboys still love it. But whether it's a good or bad parlor trick is not the point. The point is that it reveals Autopilot to be 100% vapourware.

Y cuando se ha obligado a alguien a comprar un Tesla? Lo que se hace es hablar sobre VE y recomendar unos o otros. A día de hoy, Tesla es la marca con la que menos inconvenientes tienes. Por si no lo sabes, las otras marcas también han tenido problemas y mucho más serios.

Elon talked about it some time ago. We need to tax robots.

How is that so? They’ve pushed the entire industry to electric Do you think it’s a coincidence that once Tesla started making electric cars, every major manufacturer worldwide now suddenly has plans for electrification?

Here’s the latest update on Tesla’s expected production schedule over the next few years. No word yet still on that $25,000 USD entry car Elon tweeted about last year.

What? The driver that hit the model 3 would have done so regardless of use of Summon. They weren’t watching where they were reversing. At best, maybe a human inside the Tesla would’ve mashed the horn in time, but that’s speculation and doesn’t change responsibility.

So impressed with @ elonmusk @ SpaceX Starship update and @ Tesla v10 update in the same week # Tesla # SpaceX # Starship # Mars # ElonMusk

@ elonmusk i was watching a clip from " back to the future" , and i wonder what it would be like if that Delorean was electric with @ Tesla tech in it ?! ... can you imagine what that would of been like in that movie? Damm i just realized we are living a movies dream... awesome!

Saw a Tesla this weekend. Wow I thought, “I paid for part of that car. Meanwhile who’s helping me to pay for my car”. # crickets

@ Tesla @ elonmusk Tesla V10 software update. When can we expect it in The Netherlands. Tesla model 3 Performance owner. Thanks.

just retweeted. wait a minute

Maar komt dat omdat een Tesla niet zou kunnen wat hij blijkbaar wel kan of zouden de leasebedrijven meeliften op een overweldigende populariteit en tekorten van de Model 3? ...

I don't deny that it is a sad place but why the heck are you picking on TESLA when they are actually trying to do some good here ... the fact that SOME people can't afford one does not take away the fact that they are the ONLY car company that is trying to make things BETTER

The unfortunate reality is that we have 2 choices as a society; 1) use regulation to slow the progress and be left behind by the rest of the world, or 2) lead the way... in this global economy, it's a fight to be 1st technologically. $$$ spent to slow the progress of this tech

Mars vehicles will need air locks if you don’t wish to vent the working space every time you enter. And no current Tesla has seals for 10 millibars. But heat the battery and alter the living compartment and the motors work just fine.

I live in a country which has hundred of thousands high skilled job positions unfilled and still there are millions without jobs. Not every job can be done by each person. Displacement will happen. But imagine AI making progress in other parts of the industry simultaneously

Mira el stream de Tesla en el que le gana a Jjonak hahaha !

That shows such a profound lack of understanding, esp with regards Machine Learning fundamentals.. Yes wide-scale deployment at this level of maturity has risks, but the rewards outweigh them. I imagine this learning will also result in a new active saftey feature for all Teslas.

So I was charging my # tesla @ WholeFoods in uptown # Dallas. I got a charging stopped notification on my phone. A Nissan leaf driver unplugged my car to charge his. Without even asking. So disrespectful, I just left the store. @ elonmusk

I suspect factors like sparsely populated areas (where autonomous fleets would be far less cost effective than, for ex Manhattan) pride in ownership and other very human drives will keep the private market alive and well. If the energy mix continues to shift, big enviro plus!

You folks are so literal. The technology is what he’s talking about. Of course a current Tesla is meant to function in 14.7 psi and ambient temp. But battery based transportation will work just fine with minor adjustments on Mars.

No lo sabía, pero ahora ya si. Lo veo un poco conflictivo. De caminito a tu posición si se lleva a alguien o algo por delante. ¿A quien copete las responsabilidades? ¿a ti? ¿a Tesla? A ver si cuando llega el coche a tu posición te llega con una demanda en el limpiaparabrisas.

No way SpaceX can IPO for the same reason Tesla couldn't go private. Neither would pass due diligence rounds. NASA Chief Jim Bridenstine calling out Musk is a good indication subsidies are drying up & no real VC would fund musk, so he's fucked without lube.

I think this is also 100% the reason I also haven’t gotten one yet. The only model I would consider is the X but what I really want is a Roadster with a bigger trunk...

But that's like complaining that not everyone can afford to own a business or a multiplex... focus on the net +ves - no more $$ for crappy public transportation, or any of the ownership costs of owning a vehicle today, which is money right out the window. Experience costs

There are hard to find, but looking at wall st revenue estimates which are the same as last quarter deliveries should be around 97K given that most analyst expect ASP To go down.

The problem in America is that our subsidy is now harming those that sold the most EVs, even hybrids, right up front. Tesla, and shortly GM, along with nissan, are/will be hurt by subsidies. We need to drop the subsidies, like yesterday, and replace it with increasing fuel tax.

@ elonmusk It would be interesting to own a tesla and drive it around my town. Im not sure how an average consumer, like myself, would find charging stations. Living in a smaller town seems to have it's disadvantages, but you just can't beat the people, and environment.

That’s the point. Why should we have a lower standard when it comes to the thing that kills more children (and a significant number of adults) than anything else? Car companies have built this belief that the driver is 100% responsible for the use of their product.

Sounds like a good point qualitatively but makes no sense qualitatively. Current average cost of ownership is $0.56/mi; Transportation as a Service will be less than $0.10 per mile. Owning a car for your own use will make as much sense as owning an for personal use.

It's already happening. In April, I chose to drive from AZ to FL vs. a 4-hour flight to watch the SpaceX launch. Slept in the car with air mattress a few nights but also got several hotels & Airbnb's.

Mars rovers have to survive on their own for long periods of time. A Tesla would be operating out of a base with human support. I’d guess it would be relatively straightforward to swap out parts with problematic materials and end up with something useful for short trips.

Or do as Tesla did and get rid of (almost) all cobalt.

Wrong. It can be as safe as you can but at the end of the day, is up to the owner to use it the right or the wrong way. Following your logic, all car makers should be made accountable when someone runs over a person but that's not the case because the fault goes to the driver.

You speak of car ownership like its essential... with autonomous electric cars, as Elon has stated many times, hailing an autonomous tesla will be cheaper than public transport today. My guess is most won't own anymore... they will just hail a ride, and why not!

Jag laddar min Tesla på 16A x 220V vilket ger ca 3,6kW i effekt(15-20km/timme). Då jag sällan kör mer än någon mil per dag behöver jag sällan ladda mer än 3-4 timmar. I en laddstolpe på 3-fas laddar jag i regel på 11kW(50km/h).

Holy shit. Nikola Tesla! I’m obsessed with him & how different this earth would be, had we as humans, listened to him. I’m sure there’s a lot I don’t know but I do know a bit. I don’t really dive into factual things when it comes to Einstein but his so intuned look at life and...

This is just the booster. This will get Starship out of earth's atmosphere and return to earth just like the first stage of the Falcon 9. Only the stage currently standing in Texas goes to Mars.

this sucks

Those are crashes where there is actual chain of custody/accountability on the data. That's not what I was talking about here. The piece I linked was about the cases where Tesla got physical access to the car and denied AP involvement in the crash and there was no accountability.

Ok. Enough. So now, who doesn't want to buy a Tesla? ...

The project is funded by @ AlamedaCTC Measure BB and will provide easy access to our station for the residents in the nearby communities and employees from nearby businesses, such as Tesla and Thermo Fisher. Construction is expected to be completed spring 2020.

Yes, and that is a BIG if - to achieve that price range, Tesla would likely have to keep range under 250 miles, but p/up owners by nature want close to 400 ... they should target the fleet market, sell w/out the bed and let cos customize

Yes. I think vehicle prices will rise in the future when it can earn money on its own. If you are able to buy a vehicle that is allowed on roads, at all. Why should a manufacturer sell you an autonomous vehicle when it can earn him way more as a service. See Model 3 leases

Yup. Convince the people with "progressive values" that electric car chargers are a moral good, when it's really just political pork for his Tesla-owning donors that can't be bothered to go out of their way to charge their luxury cars.

Genetic factors might give you a higher risk of attracting it, but it doesn't prove it is the reason why you got it. I do agree there are more cancers prevalent, and they do show up in the older population at a higher rate [although they are showing up more and more in younger...

Tesla just routed me home via Georgetown rd, 3 weekends in a row. Probably equal to the number of times I have been on this road in the 21 years I have lived in this area. Next weekend, I will # BreakTheStreak

Yeah, and the first air flight was also performed on an abandoned sandbar with no children or pets around. Y'all are performing free beta testing and research for a billionaire on the faint hope that senpai will notice you, and putting the lives of others at risk in the process

Yes true to an extent. Tesla along with being and inventive genius was also a mathematical wizard. His only flaw was that he went against the norm or the day and didn't appease the wealthy elites such as JP Morgan, Rockefeller and Westinghouse. Which was his downfall

1) stay on your side of the road 2) adapt your way of driving to the environment 3) DON'T USE YOUR FUCKING PHONE 4) if something drops on the floor, just let it on the floor

Sure, it's possible but it becomes less and less likely and again still less than a humans rate of failure.

I agree there may be more travelling going on. IMHO people will take a „bed on wheels“ on the first & last day of their trips to/from home. When you travel around you will chose the „bed on wheel“ most of your nights. Hotels will change from bed & breakfast to bath & breakfast.

Prettt sure it's not Tesla that wont let other OEM use the network. Just other OEMs dont want to endorse another manufacturer. Particularly the luxury players.

I'd trade in that model-T for a Tesla before it's too late. But I would imagine you have a bunch of xrp by now.

So much less congestion on the streets with all cars on Autopilot.

Anything can fail. But the chances of two systems both failing independently at the same time is astronomically low. It’s a very simple concept.

“Um no, he was just a genius:” True. But what are you saying? Not being a genius relieves us from the responsibility of trying? Check out the SpaceX presentation yesterday. If our consciousness is so rare in the universe, do we not have this responsibility 1000X?

Me too. It'll be a few years before any Model 3s get that high, but there are many high mileage Model S/X by now. Other than some outliers, battery degradation data are looking good.

Redundancy can fail too.

Do the driver seats have weight sensors (like passenger seats for airbags)? If so, and it's logged, it would be pretty easy to pull the data and show if someone was in the driver's seat. Tesla was probably too focused on fart apps to worry about that.

Tesla started the same way. For now they need to make them to attrack investors so they can get a factory (if they don't have one) and a production line.

There are videos on youtube where he says that in 1971 it passed the House of Representatives twice and the reason it didn't become a law is the Democrats wanted it higher and years after they said it was the biggest mistake they made not to pass the UBI. This may appeal to Dems!

Why would you summon your car across a busy driveway? Idiotic move.

That’s why redundancy is built in. There’s an easy answer to that

What the article FAILS to say is that Dan Neil, the colmnist highly praised in the article, awards the Tesla Model S an easy winner over the Taycan. And Neil's is more accurate on price than this piece of writing, which says that both vehicles are "over $100,000." Clever lie!

As Tesla learned very early on with their first prototype, you can’t just take an ICE platform and ICE parts and repurpose those into an electric. Similarly, taking an ICE manufacturing chain and converting to ICE will make a crappy product. Those parts are very different.

Only in shorter term, we develop different jobs, I do not think most people enjoy taxi driving or truck driving, it is bad for your health, we don’t plow the fields by manual labor anymore but we found different jobs, likely more enjoyable jobs

BTW love your Tesla articles!

Permíteme disentir. Estoy al tanto de todas las innovaciones en automoción de hace años, no ahora. Y nadie está a la altura de Tesla. Lo que ha hecho VW es modernizar su línea EV a como los fabrica Tesla. Pero sigue siendo coche y algo de software: Tesla es software con coche

1) Tesla has put out all kinds of mixed messages about AP's capabilities, and designed it to seem as autonomous as possible even at the expense of safety (e.g. the lack of ODD limits) 1a) LOL OK 2) I've never had a financial interest of any kind in Tesla's stock price. You?

They won't let them, it's one of the best selling points Tesla has.

Just wish they had a cool all electric easy-to-use model like the Tesla model 3.

Autonomous vehicles will also affect the hotel industry & airlines. Why pay for a hotel room when you can sleep on your way home?

The issue is the most the public hear about in the press is fires and crashes - both of which are far less likely in a Tesla than an ICE car - ICE cars are filled with flammable liquids and Tesla has the best car safety in the World. It's fake news, and it is misleading so many.

@ Tesla our powerwalls were empty late yesterday and didn’t top up at all overnight, no settings changed (on time based, cost saving). Anyway we can find out why?

Noooooooooooo!

You know who was a smart kid? Nikola Tesla, a man that never got the credit he deserved. He got screwed over for the Nobel Prize. Einstein was even asked "what s it like to be the smartest man in the word"? He replied I don't know why don't you ask Tesla.

I thought this was gonna be about Starship.

In terms of demand, you will be proven wrong over time. Problem is people are just discovering it and there’s allot of FUD. All you have to do is ask any Tesla owner what they will buy next. 9/10 they will not say another ICE.

Like 1/6 of the people I work with are ex Tesla workers and they all hated it. Even my friend at the VP level could only take it for 6 months.

Tesla 2020

Like? More than all delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi & uber? Automation was never about creating jobs. Fewer high skilled jobs to maintain the vehicles but overall less lower skilled jobs.

In the short term yes, but Capitalism & Government *should* be able to handle this disruption as we have handled others, technology must march on, Autonomous vehicles WILL save livesso faster is better but w/ management for worker dislocations

I’ll invest in @ Tesla if their move involves them finally paying dividends.

Maybe things will change once the corp shows profitability, but that's been promised for a while now and still remains elusive. Out of curiosity, besides Apple-style marketing what true innovations has Tesla pioneered?

Gotta and it to @ Tesla for their supercharger network. Driving though the EU, they were not only easy to use, but they were also extremely fast and very reliable. No screens needed. It amazes me that not a single OEM has partnered with @ Tesla to use their network.

La Tesla della polizia rimane senza energia, ricercato riesce a fuggire http://bit.ly/2mbITAA

After I got home & realized I had HW1 I called. Tesla told me HW 1 & 2 worked the same, it was just a different camera & nothing to be concerned about. I said I still wanted the newer cameras. They said I couldn’t get them, I already accepted delivery 3x I confirmed before!

Nope. @ Tesla

Naja, wenn's draußen nicht heiß ist (oder der Besitzer gar nen Tesla mit "Dog Mode", also klimatisiert besitzt), geht das doch voll klar, den Hund für ein paar Minuten dazulassen. Aber wenn der abgeschleppt wurde, war der Hund wohl deutlich >1h da? Das wäre wirklich asozial.

Tesla purposely reduces the lower end cars’ mileage. They recently “surprised” owners with a temporary over the air mileage upgrade for owners in the path of hurricane Dorian.

Tesla is interesting, because their workers are overpaid by Silicon Valley standards but the working conditions are legit terrible (but in a different way than at companies with midwestern management)

I don’t deny that Tesla is going through growing pains. I can tell you though as an owner of several ICE cars, including a newer Ford, as well as a Tesla, I am very happy with the latter. There are some things Tesla needs work in, but the overall technology is so much better.

Its way worse than that. He is proposing we spend millions of dollars installing Tesla charging stations in city owned garages. The same city that has no money for curb bulb outs, crossing guards for seniors, or basic bicycle safety infrastructure. Moral turpitude.

Not shocked..this guy literally sits at Hooters watching the Tesla lot in Dedham all day. Not to mention following trucks around. Now he's trying to play it up like Teslas security are after him. Hopefully they are, maybe a trespassing charge will lead him to some self reflection

@ Tesla @ elonmusk Hi, Elon, Sustainable energy for the future. Won't you be able to start a power Company using the Gigapack Battery system with Solar?. It will help with Tesla's mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.

Why not just switch, why checking with old insurance?

Memes are for the intellectual elite. The people who can afford Teslas are likely highly educated and have followed the history of memes since probably around, 1997, when google was founded. Also, his memes/tweets have spawed little businesses just from him tweeting.

I had the cash in hand to buy a tesla, then I saw that it would most certainly drive itself under a semi, cut my head off and burst into a toxic fire - so I bought a vintage Ford Pinto

When will electric commercial airplanes be a reality? And will @ Tesla make the first one?

My beef with Tesla is limited demand and profitability, along with poor corporate governance. I pointed out one of the most basic areas of the process that they seem to take short cuts on. Ford has 10s of millions of cars on the road, many older than Tesla as a company.

These are the main features of the most recent release... from a car company. Inspiring to see Tesla continue to go above and beyond, and do things no one else is even thinking about. pic.twitter.com/bUTXFhsBKM

@ Erdayastronaut - I don't know if you noticed Elon's body language during the Q/A session last night, but I think SpaceX may send a Tesla Truck to the moon and Mars as a massive PR effort. He said that a Tesla could drive on Mars. What would Ford have on that!? # Tesla @ elonmusk

Most likely, your demo of V10 will help speed up their Tesla purchase deacons.

Sounds like lidar isn’t a very practical solution. What frequency of cleaning do lidar sensors need vs Tesla cameras, that would be something to look into. And which technology is more sensitive and has less backups, I think Tesla’s approach is still practical on backup alone.

# Tesla # solarenergy # NowYouKnow Hi, Elon. Just a suggestion?!. Why not start your own powerplant Company?. Tesla has the battery Gigapack and Solar. Also won't it make the transition to sustainable energy way faster?.

Didn't mean to brag. That was a reax by someone who had never been in a Tesla. Everyone is so blown away becuz it is so very, very diff, in a good way. That's why there are so many fans, YouTube channels, fansites. It's why peo who have never been car guys suddenly become one.

And if they make the payment they will then have to deal with the Walmart litigation coming next year

Which is a problem. SpaceX is far ahead of the industry, as Tesla is with cars. But when not everyone buys a Tesla because of the price, here Elon expects to drop the price/kg to space by a thousand! SpaceX will kill all competition when the Starship will be operational.

Because they could shut down solar city and not be obligated to make the payment. That business is obviously insolvent and will never be solvent so the only reason to pay the debt it to keep the whole illusion going - and of course A narcissist’s ego

A "HONK" button is needed next to "COME TO ME" button to avoid this, too many dumbass drivers out there who act without looking. Obv Lexus fault but @ Tesla will be blamed smh

“If Tesla # SmartSummon was actually self-driving, it wouldn’t need a stop button. It would just have a # Summon button, and you'd only need to press it once.”

I do wish Tesla would switch to using a CCS adaptor in the US as well. Nobody else is going to adopt the Tesla charging format and the sooner we can get standardized on charging plugs the better for everyone.

Bear in mind that beyond battery constraints Tesla appears to have production of m3 bodies constrained to 7000/wk (90k/Q). The combination of constraints of vehicles they can make and battery cells available to them drives their pricing too. This probably drive their strategy -

Tens of thousands of non-tesla-owners-because-of-musk think otherwise. Electric vehicle growth started in the mid-90's not 2009. So long as he keeps everything proprietary to enclose his market & maintain that sweet elitism his "world changing" will be transitory at best.

How do you know they weren't looking? They could have turned there head for a second to double check the other direction. A human (in the Tesla) would have stopped and honked. The ai did neither.

@ Tesla are things like games and YouTube only on the Model 3? Because I wanted a Model S because of the free supercharge.

It's part of the Tesla experience. Same experience others have had in the US and Europe for over a year. At this point I'm amazed people with Twitter access are surprised with so many documented cases to see.

We have a Single Tesla wall connector 220v 20A (15A output) mounted on the outside of the Garage. The likely hood of us needing to charge both Tesla at the same time is extremely low. Plus the Model X has free unlimited supercharging, so it makes sense to use that.

Hi @ elonmusk. After weeks of argument with my parents, they still won’t buy me a Tesla. As a future environmentalist and engineer, I envisioned a green world which my descendent lives in prosperity and free from pollution. Let’s go straight to the point. Donate me a free Tesla.

Now you’re being ridiculous!

I’d say this is because Tesla has limited resources so why build chargers in places people won’t be using them. Sorta a self fulfilling prophecy but nothing Tesla can really do until they are legally allowed to sell in the state

I too think the end is near

Yeah people can tend to drive overly aggressive in parking lots. Also alot the summon videos show the car not paying attention to the parking lot layout. Cutting across parking spaces but summon needs to do better than that. Love Tesla but this needs to be better.

Tesla is selling cars today and part of their pitch is autonomy. Their approach differs from the long game deep pocket companies are playing because they need to move vehicles off the lot now. Nobody knows when FSD will be safe & ready so it’s hard to know what’s gonna be req’d.

I’m just naming an expensive luxury to make a point. That said, Tesla is a union busting company and their cars are unaffordable for the vast majority of people, making them useless until people can drive them.

3 posts from your social-media team implying Teslas catch fire. Are your team aware of the real statistics with regards car fires, that 50 million ICE cars have caught fire in the last 30 years? This BS is genuinely stopping people, through false fears, from considering Tesla.

Tesla price cuts account for loss of tax incentives and emptying the backlog. They are reaching closer to price points of market dynamics of supply and demand. It only looks positive going forward with good growth prospects on unit delivery sales.

From a scientific, idealistic & honest POV James is aware that Teslas are the leading car in the world. But, because his business partners and sponsors are incentivised to say otherwise, he sits by and lets a company he co-owns publish huge volumes of anti-Tesla propaganda.

The problem with batteries is the way they mine them, open cast, massive destruction to the environment. They pollute rivers as metals like cyanide are leached into the water supply...all in the name of a ‘green’ Tesla. The solution is simple. Hydrogen.

It’s creepy, of course, rich man throwing coins to the pesants, but, hey, maybe he’s just high on mushrooms & want to light up Cosmos, or a narcissist-Jesus enjoying people kiss his feets, whatever...we don’t know & I wouldn’t say no to a Tesla. https://twitter.com/Barnes_Law/status/1178331043734048769 …

My work truck is a ford, the service department leaves something to be desired

If you stop behind a car that is backing out, and they run into you, you may be in the right but such an action is dumb. Could have noticed the Lexus backing and stopped, or honked the horn to avoid. Tesla totally lacks anything in the realm of 'defensive driving'.

my roommates cat literally made me bleed yesterday (attacked me while i was peacefully doing my make up) and i just saved this bitch from kids chasing her outside. things better be changing around here, tesla !!!!

Seems like the problem is going to be how OTHER people react to seeing a car move with no one inside...not Tesla.

I really want this Tesla

That's the problem Just because you haven't been affected, doesn't mean the faults aren't there And holding a Tesla above someone's head and bragging about it being called "gods car", which I don't believe actually happened, isn't very car of the people is it

Here in PHX, theres alot of new teslas...

Make no mistake, shitty service departments are a massive problem with all domestic automakers, but the bulk of my experience has been with Ford.

I'm a skeptic and tend to question most things, but I embrace most Musk initiatives to improve our world. The motivations of his detractors elude me. Jealousy maybe?

The first cellphones were expensive as hell It takes multiple iterations for new technology to become cheap Tesla went from $150000 sportscar to $90000 sedan to a $45000 hatchback EVs will become cheaper over time

Every quarter is tough for Tesla. It will likely be that way for the next 10 years, so let’s all get used to it. I will become anxious when the quarters are no longer tough. Because that is when complacency can set in.

that’s why I’m asking this question, if you spend $100+ in gas a week you might as well drive a Tesla

In a few months leading to August Tesla opened 30 new service centers as noted by this article. They appear strongly committed to growing their service centers. https://electrek.co/2019/08/07/tesla-open-30-service-centers/ …

Musk continually rises above the detractors in this pessimistic, government regulated, litigation crazy world and proves what an exceptional dreamer, scientist, and motivator he is. Historic.

@ ordinarymarvel yeah - this might just have been an unavoidable edge case at the current technology level - low speed bump - minor damage - major hassle. Busy parking lots will prove challenging, but I have confidence in the the @ Tesla team to continuously improve.

São 30 POR DIA que morrem atualmente, em média. É muita gente. Um Model 3 custa o mesmo que um mercedes C que se vêem aos pontapés. Já para não falar de classe E e GLC que custam o dobro e passo a vida a tropeçar neles. Tesla simplesmente ainda não compensa.

Hopefully # SmartSummon brings an end to the “give your child your phone to shut them up” phase we lean on these days. I’m waiting for the first, “Our waiter made an announcement to the restaurant, ‘will the owner of a white Tesla stop blocking traffic and park?’.”

A legitimate car company would test all these things before sending it out the the followers to let them get into trouble as has already been demonstrated. Elon will be the con man of all time when the final story is written

I would use autopilot all the time, no doubt. It's just Smart Summon that I might wait a while longer to use. I can't imagine buying my future Tesla w/out FSD.

Edison was Tesla's boss but Tesla was more of a genius however he probably lacked government support. Edison used DC, Tesla used AC. It was mostly who came up with better AC or DC devices.

Cant wait to be stuck behind your dumb ass car, while it drives 1mph trying to figure out where to go. Just what we need, cars that operate even more brainless than the drivers themselves, so you can be picked up, at the curb, like royalty.

$ TSLAQ is literally non-existent as an entity in the real world, and even in the financial one. However, their indirect influence is felt: every time someone spews some bogus story about Tesla's blowing up, or catching fire, that is $ TSLAQ at work.

Hey @ Tesla , do you have any solution for disabled person ? (as driver)

I'd take not having trump over smart summon yet tbh

it’s all about exclusivity. I bet even at that price it’ll sell out, and all the very affluent tesla owners will be in line for it.

Edison was a businessman who built a factory for hired inventors, and stole liberally from people who didn't work for him, as well as ripping off Tesla by not paying him for contracted work.

I think exposing these frauds is actually a good thing ... stop concern trolling

Imagine having to sit behind this car while it takes its slow ass time, driving like a 90yr old, trying to figure out where to go. Owners arent any climate change advocates, they are simply lazy and disregard other people for their own needs.

Geen idee maar dat RDW die test heeft afgenomen lijkt me wel logisch. Ik vind gewoon waarom moet een Tesla zo snel optrekken en rijden? Onnodige banden stof met zich mee brengt. En gevaarlijk ook

Why do people talk before researching? Tesla receives subsidies, yes. A lot to companies do. Tesla pays taxes. SpaceX saves a lot of money for NASA and US military. Tesla creates tons of jobs, further US involvement in clean energy, and etc. This is good for US taxpayers.

Nothing like having to be stuck behind this brainless car, taking its sweet ass time to find you because you dont want to get wet. Great for the owner, pretty shitty if youre driving and have to sit behind this bs and wait for it to figure out what to do.

No, the issue isn't Tesla exporting - Model 3 numbers should exceed 2018 sales volume (though S and X will be down) - the issue is lack of supply of competitive EVs from all the other OEMs

You have a point. But in defense of Porsche, their stuff is a different class of reliability than Tesla. Hands down. You can use the 911 to drop of the kids, but most likely you have a more practical BMW or a Merc for that. Tesla is waiting 6months for parts. Porsche isn’t.

But what if it leaks? Or on a more serious note, why'd Tesla ditch the battery swapping idea? Seems like a much better analogue to the corner store with gas station, but requires design changes in the EV fleet.

@ elonmusk @ tesla I have a Subaru STI hatch. If there was a Tesla equivalent, I'd buy it tomorrow. Fits large dog in hatch, M3-like on track days, off-roads for backpacking trips, ok for snow in Tahoe, fits bike inside & roof rack. I'd pay extra for improved interior cleanability!

So we're skipping the walk (which most of us need anyway) and introducing a new level of hazard into the parking lots and streets that humans use. I hope you get sued out of existence.

Elon's irrational hate of yellow rears its head again.

Just an idea but The production of Tesla cars is actually more harmful to the environment tbh. I’d actually suggest going Diesel instead. Biodiesel can be made out of potatoes, corn, grass, pretty much anything organic.

I think that with what we can see, any accident would end up being a 50/50 responsibility, the police wouldn't get involved because parking lots are private property. The biggest issue is that the Tesla's owner won't be blamed for his part in the accident(+)

You obviously don’t pay close attention to tesla manufacturing. Read up on the difference between making an electric vehicle an ICE before suggesting that Ford somehow has some prowess that will be useful for Tesla

Fake! And why would you use SMART summon to go in and out of garage when you just need basic summon to go reverse or forward. Unless you have a very large driveway no need to even use smart summon feature.

You’d be better off detecting an imminent ding using sentry, asking the perpetrator to wait and move the car out of the way temporarily using the summon mode tech. If they carry on with the ding have sentry mode file a claim with their insurer.

You do understand this is an autonomous car, as I said many times this falls on user error. If you are not going to read then stay on the sidelines. I don't waste time arguing with low followers why because no one cares and I don't have time to waste on name calling

People think I’m lying when I tell them how inexpensive the car actually is. Most of them spend almost half of that just in gas every month. Love my Tesla.

Tesla has been doing well tho. Let's wait and see what happens in China. If they have another bottlenecks then, they should partner with Ford as suggested. If not, they should continue standing on their own feets

P&C carriers are going to have a field day with this shit

In terms of Elon as CEO, anyone who doesn’t think it is incredible what he has achieved with the first American car company has their head in the sand. Every aspect of Tesla, from engineering to design wouldn’t have happened without him.

Awe bummer. I hope EU change the regulations soon. Electric car and self driving car is the future vehicle.

When asked if a Tesla will pay for itself in energy/mx savings, my answer: you will almost certainly not own any long enough to offset the purchase $ of a Tesla vs a ~$20k hybrid or pure ICE. BUT if planning on spending >$30k on a anyway, then a Tesla becomes a no brainer

Right - while you probably think Tesla is self sustainable with unlimited demand and profitability

This conversation is laughable. You folks talk about Tesla like it’s some fumbling company that needs your help. Your “advice” could apply to Ford or Chevy or any of the other ICE companies whose definition of innovation is to add more body indentations.

Wolfgang missed the point didnt he? They HAVE to overstress their batteries just to add range at the same rate as Tesla, just to overcome their poor efficiency disadvantage. The reality will set in down the road when those packs degrade faster. They know this.

Zipped over to my friend's place yesterday evening so they could check out my brand new # Model3 Her youngest son is a huge Tesla fan Today I took him for an hour ride, testing out launch, fart mode, and Beach Buggy His dream # Tesla is a black Model X # kickgaspic.twitter.com/p07q7VkaX9

There’s such a depressing story behind Warrant that it would make the Tesla pick easier for me

Tesla FCF TTM and even their losses closely matched closely matched their rampups. They could have chosen not to grow and reaped the benifits of prior investments. They didn’t. You can clearly see their EBITDA which doesn’t account for DA has turned solidly positive. pic.twitter.com/w0yvtWZEW1

Ready to expand its charging network. # Tesla currently has 260+ SC, 1900+ stalls, 1700+ destination charging stalls in China.

@ Tesla @ elonmusk Can we bring more super chargers to California Central Valley?!

Ja volgens # tesla ligt het ook aan de bestuurders. Van oude diesel over in een sportwagen die dan ook nog deels zaken automatisch kan. Dat vraagt wel een bepaalde vaardigheid.

And look at the family crossing in front of the white van. Would the car have seen them pop out? It was stopped because of the cars. I wouldn't even think of using this in such an insane situation. Further it's rude to others

Each V3 cabinet supplies 1MW of power. If those are V3 cabinets, each stall could supply 1MW, which would be perfect to charge Tesla Semis!

I felt the same, weird that why it was reduced from earlier 40secs

It drives like drunk but still stops well. Someone coul make similar videos where people run into front of the car from behind when human is driving. I wouldn't do that unless it would be very good driver and knew exactly what I was doing.

Outs still to early to day of Teslas' are the "BEST" they haven't had enough history yet. Why don't we address this issue in twenty years and we'll see how many 1st generations are still on the road. My guess is not many.

It’s true though

Is V10 coming to AP1/HW1 ModelX? I have a 2016 P90DL that hasn't received it yet. Hopefully it will become available soon.

People are reporting collisions with Tesla’s Smart Summon feature https://ift.tt/2mwv2Fe

Don’t have any. And I have 2 Teslas. Any initial problems have been addressed. I was an Audi person before this, but they really fall apart after a few yrs. My Model 3 is the safest car you can drive (even over Volvos) & has never been recalled. Can you say that about your car?

This energy is reserved for who bring me a Tesla Model X! Help me help you!

Tesla soon can even survive without Elon, even if I wish he would stay "forever" I understand that he wants to concentrate on 1 million city on Mars and I hope he can do this one day fully.

This was the first time trying out enhanced summon on version 10. Basically the car driving/navigating itself to get to us. It even stopped when it saw another car coming from the side. Ignore the excited screams. @ Tesla @ elonmusk this is SO amazing! # LookMaNoDriverpic.twitter.com/8AYfeRXJrC

Not yet. Just this year they partnered up with NASA and I believe Blue Origin as well to try to solve it. NASA has historically been barred for decades from doing any research in this field because of Alabama.

I have always been a strong advocate of civil discourse, here and on Disques forums. TSLAQ does not seem interested in that, as I am on their block list here. I wonder if they realize how cowardly that appears?

You're quite right. Also, the longer the Tesla lasts, the more money Tesla can make from it when doing Robotaxi trips, so their incentives are aligned with the customer, unlike traditional car companies.

We want that in Europe!!!

You're using it wrong. Why didn't you stop it for oncoming traffic? Why are you asking it to pick you up away from the store? Why are you asking it to cross a thru street into a different parking lot?

This is their typical entitlement mentality. “We deserve it” when they aren’t even US citizens. You Indians don’t deserve shit or to skip to the front of the line. First thing they do is move extended family over and buy brand new BMWs and Tesla’s. They are all about status.

Yeah, it is impossible not to love the car!

Goes directly back to an incredibly well organized and finance effort by the Koch brothers which included several other interesting goals.

There’s one that just opened or is opening in Columbia, MD. It only has CCS. As a Tesla owner I have no need for these but I’m glad to see them rolling out so that eventually, years from now other EV owners can use their EVs like normal cars on long road trips like Tesla owners!

Doesn’t work like that. It’s not processing power that goes up in the last few percent of cases, it’s rarity. The NNs have to be trained as to every eventuality and the rarer the occurrence, the rarer the training data. It’s not proc related at all.

Agreed Kari. Tesla’s new batteries range roughly 600km on a single tank and will last 1.6million Km. At 20,000 km a year - that’s 80 years of driving. F-150 gets 80kms more per tank, last 300-400,000 km and burns a mountain of gas and costs more to run & maintain. But trucks!

I love @ Tesla and @ SpaceX but I know how @ elonmusk works — he thinks everyone should overwork themselves to make his goals a reality — sometimes less is more.

Nice! Question: based on your contacts in the AV space, from 0-10, how close do you think we are to the point where some companies in that space band together to plan a communication campaign for regulators, to lobby against Tesla's dangerous actions? Have you seen PAVE?

Yes we should question things but I do feel like it wasn't a hit piece. You have to treat your workers right and Elon has a history of doing just the opposite and in some cases has gone out of his way to make their lives a living hell if he feels they have crossed him.

Lovely blog. I'm one of those crazies who get all excited about the Current Wars. It is easy to understand when observed at an economic level--it all came down to profit motive. Westinghouse/Tesla's AC current could travel long distances from generator to user. Edison's DC 2/

Then let's agree to disagree that both of us don't know Elon's intentions. All I know for a fact is that him and tesla have been delivering on his promises and customers are happy.

I've watched it 20 times and my jaw still drops.

Toch is het zo. Toen Tesla jaren geleden begon, waren er geen laadmogelijkheden langs de snelwegen en dus hebben ze een eigen netwerk van Superchargers aangelegd. In Nederland heel slim vaak op het parkeerterrein van Van der Valk. Daardoor moeiteloos door heel Europa reizen.

Always invest in future valuations. Adoption & innovation will soar to the greatest heights we’ve ever seen with an asset such as # Bitcoin. Our world is changing - reality! It’s programmed. The most scarce asset out there today. Let that sink in # Amazon # Uber # Tesla

When’s the Tesla arriving at mars ? Looking forward to the stock pop!

USA has regulators too. Why can't they happen at the same time?

OMG. Just got fired up over a Facebook post from a guy in a # tesla group saying he was going to buy one, but read some bad stuff in @ ConsumerReports reports and @ edmunds. So he bought a Rav4 hybrid because he said it’s the best EV right now. We got lots of work to do, people!!

Deuxièmement, le coup du "faut garder le doigt sur l'appli", c'est juste un moyen pour Tesla de se dédouaner à pas cher.

Congrats on your new ride. As for wall, chiseling may be risky. If you have enough space, as it seems, how about laying a plank on the ground that lets you feel if you get close? Or curbstones to ensure clearance? Or fix a pipe as in car wash?

Aren't they pretty much banned already? AFAIK, it's easier to buy an AR-15 there than a Tesla.

Maybe they should add a feature that makes your seat uncomfortablly hot or cold when you fall asleep on autopilot.

On my wish list is scroll wheel adjustment of fan speed and temps in manual HVAC mode.

Yes. It’s appropriate they label it Beta.

Nikola Tesla was one of the greatest scientists on Earth. He could receive messages in the form of light. I have spoken of these receivers before. We are all born with this ability, we only need to learn to use it.

Regulators

They need to say Tesla

while waiting , i make youtube viseo ( trying at least). First one : is buying a TESLA good for the environment ? https://youtu.be/V-Eq5Upww2I

Det många missar är ROI. Ett bra ROI värde förutsätter få driftsavbrott, hög nyttjandegrad och låga driftkostnader. Kan bara konstatera att om ROI hade varit bra hade TESLA redan dominerat i branschen men det kanske blir annorlunda nu när VW gör entre på batteribilsmarknaden.

Det lyder helt romantisk

Al igual que declaraciones que tampoco comparto, como muchas referentes a las IA, que considero erróneas y perjudiciales. Pero que una cosa no quita la otra, y así como cuando toque criticaré estas posturas, en el caso de SpaceX o Tesla, me parece que ha revolucionado industria.

I pre-ordered my Tesla and waited 665 days for it, and it was well worth the wait. And indeed it is a dream car. It will be a dream come true for you as well — best car ever.

that tweet really hurt my feelings y'know

Parked in the back while I ran into Target just now. Came out with a few bags and tried the new smart summon feature. Got a few looks when my car pulled up front to get me. We in the future. # Tesla

TSLQ is famous for only seeing a part of the problem and going all in. They constantly miss things like the fact that the new factory is now generating rather than expending revenue, insurance revenue, game revenue, FSD revenue. If you choose to burn money, your choice.

Yeah It’s too late... well... sorta. They have a 14 day return, but the iPhone still won’t be there

True, but outdated for 5 years. Nowadays Apple devices just overly expensive, made from the same components in China. Feature parity is old story. iPhone camera is not the best for many years now. Battery life is joke. Apple pay? Never needed at all. etc.

Many will work, but not all. This one is tested by me and 100% works in a Tesla https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073X47SG4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_64lKDbB4HQ9JN …

Tesla stepped their game up and seeded V10 by putting most of the heavy download stuff in previous releases so that v10 was a lightweight install both .10.2 and .11

?? Tesla is a US manfacturer! Cars are made in California, and batteries in Nevada. They export about 50% of thier output to other parts of the world primarily Europe and China

Indeed.

A grand total of 21 do yes. That’s according to his SEC filing. His fund is valued at just over $6 million. Thats less than most fund managers’ salaries. He manages his “fund” from his apartment. There are no other employees.

Without Tesla nothing would happen. Our only hope is that Tesla takes over the market of the ICE car companies that were ironically bailed out in 2008.

Vrije energie is gewoon mogelijk, was het een eeuw geleden al, maar Westinghouse was erg inhalig. Zoek op Nikola Tesla, zoek op Royal Rife. In Rusland weet men al jaren dat Olie niet fossiel is, dus niet eindig, maar wat als het niet fossiel is? Lagere prijzen, dus minder winst.

Sans tests sérieux ? Ça fait des mois qu’elle est en test chez les clients. Et je rappelle juste une chose : le SS c’est le doigt appuyé sur l’iPhone hein. Tu relâches, la voiture s’arrête. On est loin du truc automatique. Donc en cas d’accident, c’est bien le gars le problème.

Don’t forget. Elon was a Canadian citizen before American.

So we have a picture being taken by what I'm assuming is a Woman because of the White painted toenails and the angle at which the damage occurred at. I'd like to assume that his Wife/Gf had a blonde moment and is just blaming the cars feature in order to get out of the trouble.

Seguro, todos usan carros tesla en su casa y generan electricidad con paneles solares...

Just remember, one falcon 9 fairing costs more than @marlbspiegel entire “fund”. He is not to be taken seriously. Why people quote him as if he is an expert ill never understand

Should read “Get a Tesla yourself and you will also be convinced the other cars are toast - I promise.”

I mean... it tell you the route the car will take. Are there spikes? No? Then good. If yes, then don’t allow it to go though there. Easy. Why are you being such a sissy?

Yeah sadly if you say you’re the passenger it allows. @ Tesla @ elonmusk please deactivate for safety. Lord knows there are people out there dumb enough to use it irresponsibly and make bad news for Tesla.

From your answer I can see that we are miles away from each other. You might be living what I am dreaming now

Just a little cautious since it's a brand new feature. They'll speed it up. Also stops for yield signs crosswalks and can stop for pedestrians

In the video, there are 3 cars turning into the lane at the same time. The Tesla kept turning into the lane while the car was backing into the same lane. Tesla should have stopped several seconds earlier. Instead it stopped directly behind the car that was backing up.

In a future update it can drop you off at the front of a building and go find itself a parking spot

Miners as young as seven years are suffering from chronic lung disease from exposure to cobalt dust. Not only does battery manufacturing account for 60% of the world's cobalt use, but there are also no good solutions to replace it, which is something Tesla is struggling with.

As it stands—and depending on the state in which the car is bought and withholding the individual tax situation of the buyer—some people can save up to $10,000 on a new Tesla thanks to this tax incentive.

I agree it’s a judgment call and not a black and white issue. Software is never finished. At least Tesla is calling this a Beta product - that label is appropriate. Buyer beware. I also believe things were rushed in this case due to the revenue recognition opportunity for Q3.

That Tesla are making the best cars is at best a subjective opinion and not at all a fact. What they are best at is branding. I’m not impressed by Tesla, but I like that they have forced other OEM’s to expedite the manufacturing of BEV’s.

The SUV would probably have then hunted down your children and thrown rocks at your windows, because you own a Tesla and everyone else is basically an animal.

What..? The car coming in opp direction was waiting to get into a parking spot. In addition the Tesla had to wait until the white SUV pulled forward and moved away. This is *exactly* how a human would have driven for that situation.

It appears they are not in the normal distribution tails. We are. Is it optimism? Or naive belief?

:-)

No, I meant to Tesla's work that we apparently know all about. News to me.

Tesla is so about the future, they would not go back to V2 when V3 is here

Tesla itself labels Smart Summon as Beta. It is not my label, it is theirs. I’m sure their lawyers appreciate that.

The car that was backing up hit a Tesla moving forward. That makes the car backing up at fault.

Exactly what everybody does you stop not always completely right after the stop sign

Solche Sachen sind immer am Anfang Spielereien, bis sie alltagstauglich und ausgereift sind. Zeigt aber schon ganz gut, was Tesla alles aus "alten" Autos rausholt. Bei anderen muss man sich ein neues Auto kaufen, wenn man neue Features haben möchte.

I'm not. Elon paid the price for the tweet. But his intention were not to mislead anyone. If he had money he would have taken Tesla private at 420 even the board voted with him.

I'm tired of the entire "buy a Tesla" crowd, especially from people who don't own one or an EV in the first place. Too expensive, unreliable, expensive to insure, too many people having horrendous issues, too little parts availability (if any). My used $10K Leaf? Zero issues.

Bs he was driving and messed up. Just trying to get Tesla to cover his mistake

The media nowadays has the nasty habit in pulling Tesla through the dirt instead of the ICE cars

You need to get that auto drive so we can play while we visit gyms around the country

He is a genius , it’s just the fact that there aren’t many things to pick on Elon , so trolls gotta troll . Let’s face it , we live in a shitty world and any visionary is attacked by an army of trolls . Most of the time they do it for a piece of bread .

We know what Tesla was up to. He had insight into certain areas of physics that escaped the rest of us. But he did not seem to be aware of much of the rest of physics, which say his power transmission would never have worked. Because of the Inverse Square Law.

This is all missing the point. No collision would have ever happened. The car stopped and was not in the path of the Jeep.

Then factor in the Tesla's higher insurance cost into those figures as well.

That’s an interesting question. Maybe you need to tag @ elonmusk and ask @ Tesla to make that an option, because I am sure that there are otber science places where wifi is an issue. Perhaps something GPS-based that turns it off and on automatically. I think BMW has that option.

You look at developed countries and wonder how they catch on to various crimes, it is most times because someone with accurate information spoke up. About Tesla, about Teranos, about Cambridge Analytica, Trump..."good Nigerians" need to do better

Smart Summons is being used on private parking lots. Organize and complain to the owners of these parking lots to prohibit Tesla owners from using this dangerous feature around other cars, people and especially children. Walmart will probably be open to such a request.

HW3 = chips + radar + cameras. 3D is created by merging low-res stereo camera views and checking against radar: not very accurate and sees only metal. This is why Teslas keep clobbering traffic cones. Software won’t overcome bad inputs at high speeds. A: LIDAR + better cameras.

real answer ? Maybe?Tesla has technology in their vehicles (law enforcement) that will take away many news agencies careers . Whenever a smear campaign is on it’s obvious their are agendas on the other parties side especially if their are multiple parties attacking 1 entity.

Actually it’s a fact. That’s why Tesla is the biggest car brand here in Norway. We’re not STUPID here, you know. Highest GDP, top of happiness index. Word of mouth is strong here and says *these are the best cars*. Period. Stop wasting ur time. You just got it wrong.

Girl one night is very easy. But keep a man for life is something show real power. I see the ceo of tesla, ceo of amazon, break up with his wife that just so sad. Why those wife dont forgive them. Such a long marrige and good relationship. I believe that they will miss them..

If all the soccer moms and old grannies were to drive EVs, you can fuel your 458 much longer. So it'd be wise to get as much people as possible in to an EV so the anoraks can keep the fuel to themselves.

@ elonmusk I cannot bend enough to get into a Tesla but imagine it is a wonderful ride!! @ SpaceX keep up your great advancements!!

Okay, I get it now. The Tesla was driving itself to the driver and the other car backed into it... If a human was driving it he would have been able to prevent it but wow. I wouldn't want to be the insurance agent covering that one...

Even letting go of the button doesn't stop the car immediately. It seemed to stop faster with the old summon when you let go. I always use continuous press

@ elonmusk @ Tesla Disagree with you here Elon. A small solar panel will prevent an EV from going to 0% charge if left unattended, which you know is very bad for the batt.

No sign needed because it is obvious to a person that learned to drive or just used common sense to note the way the angles were parked at,as you said. If car would be pulling out of any of those spots, the Tesla and it would be facing each other with no room to maneuver around.

@ elonmusk electrifying the current major freeways across the US could change the game. Imagine never having to stop to recharge a Tesla

Don't think so. The current U. S. government doesn't seem to realize that the global automotive industry has changed a great deal ever since Tesla started to disrupt the market and that U. S. carmakers need to adapt to the new way doing things. # lithiumhttps://twitter.com/rmattila74/status/1178291981350510594 …

Hold on, they're sending a driving "go" signal over the internet!? Doesn't it verify you are in proximity to the vehicle? Tesla continue to have a different approach to things, especially safety. Sure it's to summon the car to you remotely but you are currently still responsible.

It’s “well funded” for sure and the major shorts don’t seem to care about their 13 yrs of losses compared to 2 of small gains, It’s easy to see the correlation to waves of journo plants like the cop car they forgot to load appearing in every major publication on earth and shorts

James is an owner of the company & they have a concerted campaign against Tesla, funded by anti-progress sponsors. The fact James knows all this stuff is wrong makes it even worse. It’s not pointing out the bad, it’s a campaign of misinformation. 3 of 10 posts made ref to fires

@ Model3Owners updated to 2019.32.10 and later .11. All@of the sudden, the dash cam is throwing an error that the drive is too slow. It’s a 200MB/s drive and it’s worked since I got the car. Any thoughts? Hoping this is just an ID-10-T error on my part. @ Tesla

This unfortunately has happened in the past with regular summon.pic.twitter.com/y9X1kuH5QP

That's wise. It is true that they state these things (typically in the "fine print"/low hierarchy/manual), but they are usually muffled by some sensational verbiage in bold, a tweet etc. Tesla consciously takes on substantial risk when they choose to continue to do this

Your handle is misleading to start. We on the truthful, logical side are not sure there has ever been truth from Tesla

Well, 7kg of lithium in a Tesla and that’s good for around 250,000 to 1,000,000 miles. How does that compare to oil consumption? I’ll wait...

It's just that the pretentious, c*ck-sucking, circlejerk that the Tesla community is would probably prevent me from ever owning a Tesla in any form or way, because you guys are even worse fanboys than the GT-R community, Bugatti community, and the Koenigsegg community combined.

Bof. SpaceX est saine grâce aux subventions de l'état (voilà l'entrepreneuriat en toute sa gloire). Tesla est proche de la faillite car ils n'ont jamais réussi à maîtriser la complexité d'une chaîne de montage. Musk, comme Uber, est plus fort en comm' qu'en affaires.

Tesla's promotion of Smart Summon (text in tweet, coupled with video), as well as their promotion of Autopilot is misleading

One of these days, I will get to own a @ Tesla ... It'll have to be used because even the cheapest model is too expensive for me but living in a area with very limited public transportation, it would help me further reduce my carbon footprint.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) surprised the market with Q4 result. Deutsche bank changed the rating to Outperform, as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) reported a net revenue that soared 7%.

When pulling out of a parking spot, traffic has the right of way. Based on just the dashcam and the quickness of the accident no cop would put fault on the Tesla in a normal circumstance.

Smart summon only goes to cars with FSD or for those who purchased enhanced autopilot.

Ein all that..

Those people will learn. Tesla saves so much by not advertising (and not having to). They might eventually, but I somewhat doubt it since word of mouth about the brand is so much cheaper and likely more effective.

# RussianGP @ MercedesAMGF1 does @ ScuderiaFerrari advantage come from the energy recovery unit in the form of an electric motor drive (look at @ Tesla roadster)? Did @ sebvettelnews push his to the point of failure, in order to keep @ Charles_Leclerc behind?

Nah ain't talking about 2020. That is what musk PREDICT, is not certain. He is not known as a good predictor especially his timeline. But at the end of the day he delivers. That why Tesla is loved by its customers. They always deliver, not on time but they deliver

Stimmt gar nicht. Tesla ist ein super Beispiel dafür. Die Elektroautos haben 2 Probleme : 1) preis 2) praktische Sachen/Freiheit (wenn man eine große Investition macht , will man sich nicht auf 300km beschrecken lassen. Und es startet nicht wenn extrem kalt/ warm)

If you had bought a Tesla and it had a serious problem once you reported on it they would have said you did something wrong to cause the problem. You can't reason with crazy.

Not when they are sponsored by car manufacturers and dealers, and around 30% of their publications over the last week has been misleading Tesla content. Even Freemont police said article was misleading but no retraction.

The duty of journalists is to tell the truth. Journalism means you go back to the actual facts, you look at the documents, you discover what the record is, and you report it that way. Noam Chomsky

Maybe the insurance estimate is wrong?

But that's not entirely true, look at SAA, how many times has it been bailed out? The amount of money that we've put in SAA, had we put it into Tesla, Facebook stock or bitcoin, RSA would have made a killing. Eskom as it is is beyond repair. Denel just failed to deliver

Matthew DeBord is pretty much pro-EV in general and gives Tesla a pretty fair treatment as far as I can tell. I think often you have to go by the author, not just the publication.

On second reading, apparently Tesla released a smart summon feature while I’ve been gone. I’m assuming it’s going to be terrible lol

Except for the feature requiring the vehicle to come to your location while continuously pressing the screen on your phone. Guess you can do it with an assistant out of the vehicle.

no, all batteries have a life cycle, if you charge it over and over it degrades. This is true for all tech that uses these batteries, even a Tesla for example. Older iPhones had mediocre battery life yes, but plus models and the new ones have the best in the industry right now

No, agree. As a spectator sport it is something completely different, although robot racing could be a bit more extreme. There would be a point for Tesla to do this, as there would be no better PR for self driving.

Buildings and cars are very different. A car is actually quite a difficult thing to build well. The pieces of a car don't fit as nicely and easily as one may expect. That's why Tesla have had panel gap issues. The new workers will need time to perfect their skills.

1) “Useless” ICE or EV competition or both? 2) Who should ban Tesla- US or non US markets?-in the context of this is a border less issue 3) I presume this is satire, but satire for people like me (maybe possessing a small dose of asbergers) only works if message is unambiguous.

I meant the Ford st is £34k, £9k more you could have Tesla 3 series?

This video shows the model 3 was not in the path of the other vehicle as the other vehicle began to move. The Tesla then put itself in the path, and then stopped tenths of a second before the the reversing car. Someone driving would have spotted the hazard and stopped or beeped

@ Erdayastronaut one thing missing from the new renders was the solar panels. I never thought the fan style was going to work as shown, and now they're gone altogether? Might be a "we'll figure it out when we get there" type of thing, and big tesla batteries in the interim?

I’ll stick with Tesla

In the long run it is more efficient than electric as there is not the massive weight of batteries, also because it is quite easy to story one can make it with eg. Sun energy without nerding to do something at night. Lastly there is still a lot of development happening atm on H+

This complex line item will vary *wildly* from Q to Q, but in the longer term, it is relatively unimportant. One thing to keep in mind: Tesla runs its ops super efficiently compared to legacy automakers, so its working capital will need little incremental investment as it grows.

Well said

I reaaly think you are an idiot, if you start making electric cars for the masses they will only get more expensive, the resources for batteries are just not there. Also it will cause massive problems with the power grid, which is already happening in Amsterdam at night!

I agree Russell. If Tesla want to make the most of the opportunity with Company Car fleets in UK, they need to improve their service and employ more resource. They’re trying to go full internet sales, instead of employing sales staff.

The Tesla Smart Summon had its first registered incident. It is a reminder that technology is fantastic, but also that it should be extensively tested before it is made available. Was that the case with Smart Summon? We'll investigate. https://insideevs.com/news/373510/first-accident-tesla-smart-summon/ … via @ insideevs.com

A decade ago, Tesla was selling 1 car & barely staying in business. Motoring legend Porsche has been around for >80 years. After just 10 years, Tesla's cars are routinely (favorably) compared with Porsche's 1st # EV effort, the Taycan. Stunning!https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-timeline-from-a-one-car-company-to-porsche-rival-2019-9 …

Maybe someone can test this (just make sure they are all collected afterwards, or use e.g. plastic wall plugs to simulate) and see what happens and maybe do a blind test to see if a human notices too.

And if he does, indeed, manage to take us to Mars? Or Hell, let’s be a bit more reasonable and just say makes getting to orbit affordable? What then? The shit he’s pulled with Tesla doesn’t just disappear.

Tesla'nın bu konu üzerinde çalıştığını hiç duymadım. Ancak ruhun varlığı üzerine araştırma yapmış bilim adamı olarak Dr. Duncan Macdougall'ın ''21 gram deneyi'' ni okumuştum. bu deney de ruhun varlığını ne yazık ki net olarak ispatlayamamış https://youtu.be/to-wjP-6iYA

I wonder how long before the cops are called on someone using smart summon. Or how long before laws are proposed against its use. Not because the concerns are valid, rather because people don’t like it and feel it should be banned.

Ça dépend du mode de production de cette énergie électrique en l'occurrence

0 point energy is the energy in the air and space around us at all times. Free and endless. Tesla found a way to tap into that. His work stolen, hidden. Climate change ends immediately when his work is released. They won’t say that though. They want control over the green tech.

Lol, ou pas

As annoying as this is, I laugh at how it took just 1 day for the internet to be full of Tesla summons ending badly (although majority I've seen are other drivers faults), but shows how hard carparks really are

@ elonmusk New rule: only Tesla owners can go to Mars

Convince the people that we need to transition from OIL (control) to green tech (solar, wind etc) but that is still under their control. The CONTROL doesn’t change. Zero point energy, Tesla figured it out. Free endless amounts of energy. Feds stole his work. 0 point=freedom.

Only works when parked. By the time it's enabled while the car is in motion, the Tesla will drive itself.

Agreed. Driver is always demanded to avoid accidents, no matter what is happening. Cant just drive in front of another car because the other one was driving recklessly or speeding. Nevertheless, the other party hasnt obeyed the law in the first place.

They are talking so much about it that i am thinking of selling my kidney to buy a Tesla

That's weird

I can only imagine the feelz all the other drivers in that parking lot felt when they realized that Tesla was taking up a traffic spot in a busy parking lot with no driver. It's like who do you get mad at?

Thanks for letting me borrow your Tesla to deliver food to the homeless shelter you opened bro

Nice joke but not practically possible SORRY

It is a very advanced car but one does then hear tales of poor build quality and hopeless availability of spares: which coupled with range worries, for our use at least, does put me off.

Does the converse apply too? Telsa drops you off at the entrance and you tell it to go find a parking spot on its own.

I want to drive a @ Tesla amd have an experience of a lifetime but unfortunately im not that rich to afford one

What if you go to an amusement park and your car is really far away. Better to just sit on a bench and wait for your car. And you don't have to remember where you parked it.

Prueba del Tesla Model 3 [VÍDEO] https://grandesmedios.com/prueba-tesla-model-3/ …

Ja? Tesla tex, och andra bilfabrikanter som följer efter. En del firmor som konverterar fossilbilar till eldrift har startats i bla Kalifornien och Frankrike. Men som du säger det är inte vanligt att privatpersoner bygger elbilar.

ice cars are shit. Fuel takes too much energy to transport to every little gas station and pipes are expensive. Power lines though low maintenance and far cheaper. Better efficiency if fossil is burned at a power plant than a car too. ice cars are going to die.

@ greentheonly “it’s stopped at stop sign”

Yes. Because the car lacks human situational awareness and the driver was driving blind. Simple logic says it can run over people this way too. The car's perception grasp is very poor. Really really not ready to drive on its own. Super reckless. I should probably sell my stock.

The future is here-all other cars rapidly becoming redundant/pointless. Remember this applies retroactively to virtually the whole Tesla fleet. I.e. cars sold several years ago. I.e. Tesla’s don’t really depreciate, they simply keep getting better over their very long lifespan https://twitter.com/Supermantibody/status/1178138323086430208 …

As someone who has a 25mbps connection through satellite, out in the middle of nowhere, with a wifi repeater that connects to the car... This is great. I often would go out to the car to see if it was still downloading or if it got disconnected.

This is good and I do 80% of these things. However cold isn’t really an option in northern hemisphere countries I don’t think and surely just ditch car use rather than buy a Tesla, as manufacturing them creates omissions.

From the responses here I’m starting to understand your problem tbh James. You’ve created an echo chamber of closed minded petrol heads, and despite your usual desire to be balanced and scientific, you clearly can’t crawl out of the chamber that traps you on this one.

Dude the point is the Tesla didn't drive over the small barrier and rip its bumper off. It instead circled around avoiding it to get to its owner, thus saving him a trip to the service center and a bill.

Spotted a video of a Model 3 going through a stop sign in a car park yesterday. It’s a shame they release this tech before it’s properly tested.

That’s because he is used to the same tech that’s been out there for 100 years. If he drove a Tesla for a week he’d never want to go back. That’s how it works.

The sensor suite being used is exclusively the ultrasonic distance sensors used for distance measuring. No cameras as used for the Lane Assist function. It’s weird, as if these engineered considered what was safe with available technology and then built it. Totally undisruptive.

@ Tesla @ elonmusk How about a software update for the # Model3 so that when it's at home and on wifi it can expose dashcam/sentry footage as network shares? Save us from having to disconnect/reconnect USB devices every time someone does a double-take at the car while walking by. :)

Yes I do dream one day we will not feel on the streets as in a factory with loud noise, gases from burning fossil fuels that we breathe. I do not know the tehnology of the engine that will be but I do know that all the engines in a car are electric besides the main engine.

The thing is very practical as it can drive in and out of parking spaces without you in the car. It won’t drive very far, maybe 1.5 car lengths. All communication is done via Bluetooth which means the driver needs to be in close vicinity and communication lag is negligible. 2/x

But... 16? Tom, you know better than me, but do Tesla drivers have a different charging pattern to other EV drivers? Are they more likely to Supercharge than home charge?

We should have as many 150kW locations as Tesla has Supercharger sites by the middle of 2020, and as many actual units as they have Superchargers by the end of 2021. Don’t need as many per site as we won’t be offering free charging, and other networks are expanding, too.

I blame Tesla for innovating too fast. Others are having a hard time catching up. And @ elonmusk is also right on that @ Tesla has accelerated EV transition by a decade maybe two. Who thought people would be wanting EV in India in 2019! I expected it to be near 2030!

It's not about running away but expanding out to the Solar System while taking care of Earth. Tesla is about the latter, speeding up the (inevitable) transition off fossil fuels is their mission statement. And it's just one company - many more are working to make that a reality.

Ask 100 Tesla drivers if they’ll ever go back and they will all say no. Most of us owned BMWs, Jags, Porsche’s, Range, Mercedes before. That should be a big clue. Tesla make better cars, you guys are deliberately misleading your fans on that fact.

Soo...if I rent a Tesla, want to do 80 on autopilot?

Maybe I should make a gofundme for y'all to buy me a Tesla.

@ elonmusk how come you can send a Tesla into space but not to my house?

That would be in time. But it should slow down dynamically, because others don’t understand the somewhat binary behavior.

It’s not perfect but it’s slow and careful and the car stops instantly when you take your finger off of the button. On the highway autopilot is phenomenal for miles and miles.

As always, Musk is Tesla's biggest asset & liability. It wouldn't have gotten to where it is w/o him, but his inability to work w/ others killed so many opportunities. His ego just doesn't fit even in the "biggest building in the world".

Those are some feels bro! Get your paper in assets though! Something that'll appreciate over time such as stocks. Value means a lot more than price. Berkshire is around the same price as Tesla however it has over $500 billion more in assets!

This will certainly solve the voter ID brouhaha of the early 21st Century.

Of ik extra vroeg ben opgestaan in de hoop om de @ Tesla V10 update te triggeren? Maybe...

Isn’t the Tesla supposed to be almost self driving? Shouldn’t it detect other cars at 5mph in a parking lot?

It was the best way for them to exit honorably. Musk however has a penchant for creating future liabilities & Tesla's multiple raises were predicated on becoming a major player. They had a mcap of ~20B with <100K cars sold. Their tech is good but not enough to command a premium.

It makes me wonder what might have happened if Tesla merged w/ a smallish auto co to acquire expertise in mass manufacturing, maybe in 2014-15. Sort of the way Sony bought Minolta's camera biz. Prob. not realistic given who runs Tesla, but could have made a difference.

I think a little envy is healthy, as it can spur competition. I want a shiny, sexy Tesla. I am envious that others have one. I want my own though; I am happy others have one because that means they met a goal I'm working on, and that's cool. But I still want one

No no. What i mean is a company like Tesla who is investing privately for the charging infrastructure. Right now the power charging infra are being built by petrol companies and shopping centres. No car company is doing the infra. Perhaps Geely/Proton can start. Or Perodua.

(The point is that the number sign is redundant, because "VIN" stands for "vehicle identification number.") Adding "#" after "VIN" reads "vehicle identification number number," which could use a correction.

Taycan delivers and the price is right. Could too expensive for some that can afford a Model 3 only. Too slow needs to be seems. Seems that the Taycan is conservative on specs and Tesla’s only meet specs with perfect conditions vs the Taycan simply when you floor it.

The number of people telling @ etclectric to just buy a Tesla Model 3 when she’s just made a video stating what she can and can’t afford is... appalling. https://youtu.be/KO5pjARLWS8 It shows how out of touch some people are with how others live.

Try to think of use cases for this feature. Say it's raining heavily and you just got out from the mall with your kids. The Tesla isn't parked in any indoor parking space and is merely in the outside lot. Pull up Smart Summon and you don't have to get you and your kids wet

What country you in? USA here, Model X, FSD - waiting on V10 :(

Once orbit, landing, and full reusability is achieved, full cargo payloads can be flown around the world insanely fast creating a massive new revenue stream. Cargo ships on sea will become antiquated over night. Six months to orbit...LETS GO!

I think they are targeting a different customer. It is pretty analogue. Unlike Tesla and Rivian. Pity the range is only 200 miles, though. That will put many people off.

For me, it depends... Depends on type it road, number of lanes. Just do it what the way I do it , because you spent 33 years perfecting it.

Hey @ edmunds you forgot @ Tesla model 3. I know your going q because of Tesla but...

So why did @ Tesla pull out of Forza along with Rolls-Royce?

V10 is awesome! But just received notice of another update, not 12 hours after the first one, without any explanation on http://tesla.com , Twitter, etc. Look at the user groups. People are nervous. How about a little more communication with your # S3XY family @ elonmusk?

I've used summon before when it was raining & had everyone like then another time to park in a flooded area that was the only available parking in the lot. Then summoned my car out of the water when I was ready to leave # NotSoUseless

Pretty soon @ elonmusk will have such a ridiculous amount of money from @ SpaceX that there will be absolutely nothing # tslaq can do to hurt the mission, @ elonmusk, @ Tesla or the stock price any longer. Escape velocity is very nearly achieved.

I'm the spirit of transparency, Edmund list does not contain Tesla since Tesla does not pay Edmund salary. Not a trusted and neutral source.

Also, considering the Tesla's self-driving mode either slows you down somewhat hard and late when someone merges to your lane, or too late when the highway is cluttered up and stopped ahead, I'm happy you can toggle it off. There are things humans do better than machines.

Crazy to think that by 2021 they want to be able to use the Tesla fleet as robotaxis, charging 1/10 the price per mile of an Uber, at least in major cities where authorized.

A current production model Tesla would last long enough for the fluids to boil off in the near vacuum. Coolant (yes Teslas have coolant), 12 volt battery acid, washer fluid. Martian nights would be solidify the drivetrain oil and incapacitate the main batteries. (Just a guess)

- everything points to a Tesla EV having a better resale value 2 or 3 years from now compared to an ICE vehicle of any brand. - if the leasing company takes that into account now, the lease pricing should favour the Tesla at the same initial purchase price.

Yes it is actually as easy to charge up a Tesla as it is to fill up a tank of gas. Either case if in hot persuit the suspect will be long gone by the time you’re done filling the tank.

Tried smart summon on my # Model3 from my garage. Stood out on street near my driveway. Instead of coming to me, it went backward and nearly smashed into my garage wall. Don’t know when I’ll try it again. Seems to need some work still. Hope they fix things soon. @ Tesla @ elonmusk

Almost 24 hours with the tesla and ... the Volvo XC90 is struggling to exhibit a single trait which would make me prefer to drive it. The silent acceleration is ... stunning. Likewise the display just works so well.

Could it be to distract from the Advance Summon revenue recognition-influenced rollout? Maybe to distract somewhat from upcoming deliveries announcement and its implications for total revenue? To distract from related-party SpaceX purchase of Tesla batteries to boost Q3 Revs?

Don’t buy a Taycan. Everyone is praising this car for being so amazing, but it’s $150,000?!?! Everyone told Tesla their cars are wayyyyyyy too expensive. But they most expensive Tesla is $143,000 and it’s just a better car. Taycan is trash

I don't make that assumption. Elon's antics at Tesla probably didn't help much if at all. I do know he lost interest in Crew Dragon about the time NASA told him they weren't going to go with propulsive landing. Red Dragon died at the same time and he embarked on starship.
