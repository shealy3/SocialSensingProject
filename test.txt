HOWEVER Ryan & Yaz not knowing Tesla was shocking enough already, but this new one I can't believe. Graham having never heard the word "pathogen" ??? I get that the show's explaining it for kids but did you really have to dumb down the companions THAT MUCH ? # DoctorWhopic.twitter.com/y193VrqiBH

Dreamt that my dad bought a Tesla but the interior was a nissan I was so confused

Nah dawg we put Tesla motors on these bitches were gonna drift back into the past!

There won’t be a US trade deal until the EU one is sorted. Tesla is opening a EU factory soon anyway. Will wait for that. Assuming Johnson capitulates to the EU, like he did last time.

Hey Elon, let me drive a Tesla! I don’t know about NN’s yet but I’m working on it!

I think he's referring to a wife that helps with car things.

Innocent people don't need to prove their innocence

Read about "war of currents" between Westinghouse and Edison. and stop using Twitter and smartphone as they are capitalist inventions after all.

Tesla/hummer pushing EVs for the people are the step we need most. Utility will change peoples minds.

@ Tesla you guys should open up a branch in Oxfordshire, England. Would sell a lot of cars. I'd be dying for the opportunity to sell these cars to people! And Giga factory UK wouls be a dream one day. Could produce all the RHD vehicles!

I wanna see Tyreek race a tesla

Problem is everyone of these people is chewing through research about Tesla and Ai that they get so far inside the box as to not see the box. Send my ticket I'll come totally unprepared. Not a GCSE to my name and make knight rider for you in a bit, when I'm baked!

so in my personal finance class, one of our semester-long projects is investing (fake) money into the stock market and all of the stocks i chose (wal-mart, which was assigned, tesla, adobe, 3m, paypal) are doing bad except tesla which is doing gangbusters for some reason

I don’t own a Tesla but I made near $45k I’m January in $ TLSA stocks / options because I believe TSLA is the future. CN I get an invitation ?

But Tesla has said it's complete since 2016...

So what are you saying? Software is irrelevant?

Tesla is a status symbol. As any luxury/premium vehicle is. Duhhh.

It’s upntonyountonlook after your investment. Any sane person would PPF vulnerable areas. No accounting for stupid.

@ elonmusk @ Tesla 2 feature requests. 1. Low power mode - use when parking at an airport to put car in lowest possible battery drain mode (bonus if you can enter a date when you return for the system to manage the battery).

Hi @ elonmusk, It would be interesting to have the option of controlling our Tesla though # Alexa or # GoogleHome. Will we have this in future?

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) surprised the market with Q2 result. Credit Suisse changed the rating to Underperform, as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is trading at over 80 times its book value with a trailing PE of over 40.

Yep. 2000+ new cases (reported) in the last 24 hours. Foolish not to take this seriously. At least with the flu, you can get immunized (and if you haven't please do - you don't need to add to health care workers' burden).

I would have slid right into Nikola Tesla’s DMs. pic.twitter.com/R1bk7UI0Sl

I personally know of an April build with 3.0. The answer I got from @ Tesla was that 3.0 units were being prioritized for S/X so not all 3’s got it early on. Only cones now, but there will definitely be future features that utilize 3.0, and now I’ll have to pay $10k+ to get it

Elon Musk is the living representation of the saying "if there is not a way, make ONE". He literally went against the world and built everything he wanted by himself. SpaceX and Tesla story frfr is

And Tesla has yet to spend a single dollar on marketing.

@ elonmusk Has been following Tesla Since 2013 Will like to work with Tesla in India? Currently doing my MBA from Primier Institute

Edison was known for stealing credit for a lot of his 'inventions' he even stole of few from Tesla. But the story is one of his workers created it and it was a black person who did it. However Edison had money and the power and received credit for it

To each their own - all DIY are not necessary - for about 100 years people have enjoyed working on their cars. My friend had a 92k car and loves DIY on it. Not a Tesla. This is actually very common amongst car enthusiasts. Might 1 or 2 YouTubes on the subject.

Tesla already makes a 15" and 17" screen with integrated operating system. Why not just make a portable version? Think of what the AI could do for selfies!

He might have seen it before. Now he certainly has. Tesla in The Netherlands has been great and the owner is such an enthousiast he is using his one-off as a daily since the start.

Yea tell me again why Tesla shouldn't have built its own supercharger network. This is exactly why! Imagine how they could have been put out of business if the fast charging network was in the control of other companies.

Can someone confirm what @ Tesla's peak vehicle delivery rate is? As I recall, its something like 10K cars per day, which we normally see in the last few days of the Q. Anyone have any reference to this number? Trying to find more exact numbers with supporting documentation. Thnx.

Would love some details on what’s getting installed.

Perhaps a good thing, “At this time, @ StartEngineLA does not accept investors from Canada or the United Kingdom.” Now do I buy some more Tesla shares instead (while still regretting I’d didn’t get round to it months ago, before the surge)…

Although manufacturing of batteries uses rare minerals and many gallons of water, they, as @ TomRaftery noted, have a long useful life.

Büyük petrol üreticileri ve para babaları Teslanın bu teknolojiyi geliştirmesine izin vermediler. Bu yüzden Teslaya para vermeyi kestiler. Tesla elindeki son parayı bu kuleye yatırmıştı bu yüzden beş parasız kalıp bu zalimlerin eline düştü.

Based on immediate availability, cost, and style; I've shortened my list of EVs of interest to: 1) Tesla Model 3 SR+ & 2) BMW i3. If I was forced to purchase a new car today, I'd get a used i3 because of the lower price.

Tesla debt is trading at par. I think he might be able to pull it off. I can't see there being much demand for equity here. Recall he raised debt back in 2017 when the stock was 380 and everyone thought he was a moron. When equity was 200 he could only raise a measly $1B

Your right. This isn’t getting much play because it reads like “Rich environmental car buyers get charged a tiny bit extra”. The public perception of Tesla is only for rich people so it’s hard for any sympathy to exist.

It would be great to have Tesla service stations where you do what you want and they charge your car and park it afterward so someone else can charge. The more Teslas sold the more there will be superchargers needed because many will not have charging access at home

Fair enough. But even at 54k, I would be pretty pissed off if I had to do any DIY on my car for at least 10 years. That thing better purr for at least that long.

The one argument that the Y will cannibalizes 3 sales is false because initial Y sales will be the higher LR and Sport variants, so there will be a big price differential between it and the 3. You will also see great gross margins with those high price variants too.

That's why I think the US govt has secretly declared SpaceX and hence Tesla "systemically important companies". I think we have a race. SpaceX just has! to launch its first commercial mining endeavor before USD collapses.

Waymo vans actually drive unattended. So, that indicates they are ahead.

They put them in the database assumptions but the model then predicted no investments. Interestingly Tesla as usual ignores the beancounters, does the opposite to the market, and adds 50% to its battery. In time we will see who was right, Tesla or the model.

Kann man so sehen muss man nicht. 1. Tesla forstet wie gesetzlich gefordert 1:1 Mischwald in Brandburg auf (Brache wir zu Mischwald) 2. Tesla forstet zusätzlich nochmals das doppelte (ca 600ha) der gerodet flache (ca 300ha) in Brandenburg auf. 3. Tesla siedelt Fauna um. 4. usw

consider all of the different technological directions we could've taken even within industrialism, such as tesla's inventions there's no reason why future technological developments would be the same as current industrial system

Musk has a challenger that I think may just be better, stronger, faster and sexier than the Tesla. https://twitter.com/GMC/status/1222904131574255616 …

That would be cool!

Only A to B comparisons. The lie they are on a superior development track can persist as long as there is no wide retail availability of better product. Waymo doing driverless rides is a crack. Cruise demo is another wobble. Now the argument is "summon is bad on purpose".

Do I need to stop calling things the "Cadillac" of, and officially replace it with "Tesla"?

Well, notify me when Tesla will do more affordable and serious cars. Anyway, i love you Elon. Definetly not g4y.

It's not intelligent to call everyone who has a good firsthand testimony about tesla products a "hack" i.e shill I thought $ TSLAQ is the paragons of facts and objectivity?

En anden del af forklaringen er at Tesla levere deres biler i Europa i batches, enkelte store leveringer med skib fra USA. Det betyder at leveringer i DK svinger meget fra måned til måned og altid er størst op til en kvartalsafslutning.

Wow! (and I thought the Chinese Tesla gigafactory was done in record speed). Maybe they consulted with Elon and how to get this done? Amazing.

Ross likes Tesla because it gives the employees no say. He must hate unions. He also hates the homeless. What kind of liberal is he? I'm genuinely confused. https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1224019149040406528 …

Not sure, you might be very much correct, but it “defrosted” cameras as showed in pictures in just 10 min.

Do those make it quieter?

Difference I would say is this is a result of intentional design decisions by Tesla that are blatantly predatory which puts them in a different category altogether.

?, my car drives itself 95% of the time already. Can’t wait until Elon actually “starts” then. You know almost every Tesla is gathering real world data through vision, right?

Elektrische auto's gaan pas een impact maken als de massa ze gaat gebruiken, maar dat gebeurt niet in één dag. De €4000 is ook voor auto's onder de €45000, dus tesla kopers krijgen geen korting. Ik denk dat zo'n regeling ervoor zorgt dat er meer goedkope EV's ontwikkeld worden.

Yeah I thought so too but having @ tesla twitter/YouTube community there posting videos would get even more word out to qualified talent that @ elonmusk is hiring!! I think you’re getting an invite!!

actually.. my first thought was that the volvo dampens the impact better than the tesla.. but then... this is probably only good for all passengers except the driver..

IIRC, Tesla FSD capabilities include not dealing with potholes, missing manholes, or any obstacles below the ground line. On Mars, where there are no roads - as for now-, shouldn't it be high in priority list? Hopefully someday FSD become able to deal with road "events".

So you think if Google had a checkout like this, it woukd be ignored by the media as has this issue with Tesla? I don’t think I need to be a tech genius to figure that out.

Not short the stock. It's a common theme for him to "not advertise" Tesla on twitter when things are bad. Why let everyone know about his hackathon if it's private? I'm just trying to read between the lines, stop looking for shorts/longs narrative. Boring

that's a dream job tbh. Corona or any virus I'm in

The luxury of a Tesla shouldn’t be kept and should be shared. Premium separates e-cars from potential customers (and Earth needs those customers) that should go green. Going green shouldn’t be a luxury, it should be frowned upon to NOT go green.

Tesla is certainly planning on releasing some FSD stuff soon. Agreed that it is likely some city driving stuff. It is going to be dangerous as all hell but, combined with "smart summon," should hopefully put the robotaxi fantasy to bed forever.

@ TESLAcharts's dictum- whatever Elon is talking most enthusiastically about is the most glaring problem for him at the time. The goof about FSD in the Q4 call is probably lighting a fire under him.

Zusammenfassung: Taycan fährt mit 18,4 kWh größerem Akku weniger weit als Model 3. Das einzige, was man ihm zugute halten kann ist, dass er bei Tempo 150 nicht deutlich mehr verbraucht und so doch dem EPA Wert trotzt. Ob das 200.000 Euro wert ist, sei jedem selbst überlassen.

From contrarian perspective this is how I see it. Tesla may be about to release an FSD related feature soon. May be red light stopping. He may be trying to create some short interest before releasing the feature. I think short interest makes an important part of his income.

I agree Otis - I do love my Model 3. However, Mr. Know It All over here has me quite upset and I’m not afraid to show it.

I did not claim the Tesla was not at fault, however, the oncoming traffic also had a red light at the moment of the accident as shown by curb lane stopping, the Tesla driver had yielded to turn, and established as you are supposed to. They are still at fault, but SUV ran the red.

I think he has been up for like 72 hours at this point. The coke is running low. Already recorded that song with Grimesz. What is left to do but wax poetic about FSD until the valium kicks in and you can finally get some sleep?

Mr. Musk, I was thinking about Tesla's coil. Could you develop a residential coil as a source of energy and then avoiding wire in our devices? Also, helping to integrate our IoT. It was just a thought

Sorry if I missed the sarcasm, but the towing capacity in Teslas are insane because the motors have max torque at 0 rpm. Throw in the other fact that you can get a Tesla with 2 motors... It's no contest.

over the next couple of weeks I will lightly enlighten you with the words of Nikola Tesla. (as I’m currently reading a collection of his published articles) I hesitated about creating a thread, fearing it may be overlooked. Actually, should I?

i'm afraid to even know what i was talking about.

you should probably just move here and save on flights

@ elonmusk if one Tesla is travelling next to (or near to) another do they communicate to each other, and therefore assist each other, in knowing what maybe further "up the road" or "around the next corner"?

How about making autopilot software opensource? That will revolutionize the Tesla Autopilot system.

I think they underestimating the unreleased FSD @ Tesla got. They're comparing the current version of Autopilot that is no way near to FSD. I believe FSD is a major push update than a flick of a switch on current Autopilot.

@ JackMasseyWelsh ever down for a bmw vs tesla video?

The NHTSA has the crash safety data. Tesla just has autopilot data. Crash safety was more of the focus of the conversation

Das kann man so pauschal nicht sagen. Wir gehen im Video übrigen davon aus, dass ein Tesla Model 3 Long Range Allrad weniger geschafft hätte als unser tiefergelegtes heckgetriebenes Model 3. In anderen Tests fuhr dieses Model 3 11% effizienter als ein aktuelles Allrad-Model 3.

I'm confused you're using my talking points here... Perhaps you were being sarcastic in your first comment? People avoiding things they don't understand would be the worst type of people (to me). Tesla knows what they are doing(hence my comment)

Thanks. It's going to open at $15000 tomorrow, people will start to quote Cathie Wood and stop quoting Warren Buffet, Elon will declare himself Emperor of the Galaxy and ship me to Sgr A* to punish me for the offense of short selling Tesla stock. It's gonna be great.

The exact intersection of the science & magic lines. I love Tesla coils beyond all reason, especially when they’re used for this.

Then Tesla should have refused. Once they started the work, they accepted liability.

Maybe it’s a feature. With FSD you don’t need to look ou the windshield anyway.

You make a valid point. Someone should ask him this because even @ Uber struggling on this. @ Tesla @ elonmusk

I don’t care what people want to drive. My point was all these Tesla fan boys telling me how I’m killing their children while they are trading their 3 in for a less effecient Cybertruck. It’s HYPOCRITCAL. If they cared that much, they would continue to drive the more effecient 3.

@ Tesla is better , clean and faster.

Lol well my car will be very very very visible and in the center of attention, cuz what I want is a futuristic car, either cyber truck or something else, I'm a Tesla fangirl even though I don't own a Tesla yet

Tell me what? If you’re going to tell me that Tesla is fraud and lies without regulation, you need to be ready to tell me that every ICE company operates the same way, and that we can’t trust what they say. And by that logic, every company or government is fraud and corrupt.

you’re going to “flat earth” me? you’re parroting Tesla, when the NHTSA said “5 = 5” The NHTSA disavowed Tesla

He’s an oil ICE car shill and he publicly attacked Tesla as a fraud. Which is horse sh-t. He is also financing Tesla q. We’re not fans of scum street.

Hi Elon I am a retired chemical engineer who is fascinated by all things Tesla. I have often wondered about the autosteer on my Tesla, and have a lot of ideas on how to make it better. No experience with AI though, except two Stanford courses in 1969 and 1970.

I really appreciate your feedback! I don’t know any female race car drivers so this isn’t a viewpoint I’ve heard before. I agree a lot of things that could benefit women could also help men too, but I’m still left wondering why we don’t have these features in cars (esp in Tesla)

I wish I could come! Dang! I need a cooler job Do you need a Behavioral Neuroscientist/Neuroinformatics person? Maybe not at Tesla but Space X? I could do microgravity/radiation/human performance research on the astronauts! Or at Neuralink?

No, I have not. I’m basing my argument on what the general public says, and what data shows. Individual experiences of flaws and glitches are not good in any sense, but not a representation of the overall safety or reliability.

1. Perhaps Tesla spends 0 because they have 0 to spend lol they aren't very profitable, at all. 2. Hummer will see an entire new fan base now that it's electric. 3. It's easy to 'say' what you'll do until you actually do it. Plus opinions can change pretty easily.

I can tell, you don't do much research. Electric cars aren't happening anytime soon as a daily driver. And Tesla isn't all that. Pull your head out of your rear end and realize the combustion engine is forever

Finally drove a @ Tesla, I’m now a believer and need one! Speed, power, user experience, comfort and so much fun! # changedman

For the few that are, no doubt they should be taken care of. The frustrating thing here is how TSLAQ will use anything possible (including this) to tarnish all tesla and all electric vehicles. I realize that follows zero logic. That the logic morons will use.

Yeah but tesla was in love with a pidgeon so mayhap all his ideas we'rent the best. If its bouyancy, why do things lighter than air always go up and not sideways or down. I have researched flat earth and found it was full of flaws though

Several years back, driving in traffic and saw a Model S. I couldn't stop staring and thought it was one of the most exotic cars Id ever seen. I thought it was a mere fad and novelty back then. Then I saw another and another and another and lusted after one for myself!

Not bc it wasn’t feasible (we now know without a single doubt it is feasible & is used in several devices). Tesla also designed the first hydroelectric power plant in Niagara Falls harnessing energy from water. But why shouldn’t we implement it further ohh big oil big gas

And you can’t just say “no” when presented with government data that disproves your point. The data you presented helped my argument, you can’t just say “no” when I show how. Like I said, find data that actually disproves the fact that Teslas are among(or the) safest cars.

See you didn't notice the sign. The sign next to the left turn light. States when not green. One must yield to all oncoming traffic. Thay is why the Tesla is 100% at fault.

All you need is about 5 days delay between delivery and actual confirmed receipt of payment to account for the AR figure. 5 days. But considering how end of Q heavy Tesla's deliveries are, it reality is it could be 1-2 days. You know as well as I that end of Q is always a push.

I’m talking about comparing Teslas to Teslas. Autopilot + safety features vs no safety features, autopilot + safety features is roughly 2x as safe. It’s not “what Musk says”, it’s company data that legally has to be (and is) correct.

Both failed to notice the sign next to the light. It states when not green. One must yield to all oncoming traffic. That is why Tesla driver was at fault. Failed to yield the right of way.

What Uber, Apple, n Amazon have experienced in their attempts to crack the Chinese market should be clues that # Tesla will have a tough uphill climb even if it builds its own factory in Shanghai. # NIO short sellers B careful what u wish for.U just might get a return gift on Tesla

What Tesla likely has done though is chose a relatively low percentage.

listen fuck the whole Tesla shit @ DavidDobrik just pay a year of my rent and let’s call it good

the right thing 90% of the time / in 90% of plausible situations to 99% to 99.9% to 99.99% of the time, etc. Therefore the only way to define a "FSD-ready system" for anyone is to choose an arbitrary percentage and go "yeah that's good enough".

Saying "this system is enough for FSD" is an abbreviation. Due to Reality being a perfectly random chaos (see chaos theory) it is physically impossible to design a system that will do the right thing 100% of the time. Instead it's all about chasing the tail end: Going from doing

Great! Let me know when you're ready to go 100% with a @ Tesla # powerwall2 battery!

Can u imagine? Endgame Grüne gegen Linkspartei? Tesla's gegen Elektronisches Ladas?

Dann braucht Tesla halt ein Automatikgetriebe mit mehreren Gängen. Aber in der Biografie (auf audible schön anzuhören) wurde gut erklärt, warum Tesla drauf verzichtet hat.

Abrupt ending. Liked it more than Tesla, less than others. Should replace Yaz or Ryan with the talking cat.

Was für ein Spannender Test von @ nextmove_de. Da sieht man mal, dass der Taycan zwar bei geringen Geschwindigkeiten abkackt, dafür seine Reichweite aber ganz anders als Tesla auch bei höheren Geschwindigkeiten halten kann! pic.twitter.com/gkMz0dnEeT

Hi Elon. AI and chip architecture, and data loops, of interest. I can research quickly. Cool too get paid, and not sleep in truck, or waist time, gambling in a casino. Contract via e-mail, I'll apply at Tesla, but will work from here, or where ever i'm at in any given moment.

Otis don’t take his side here!

@ RealistNews time to sell the Tesla and the Honda if ya got one.

I didn’t capture the whole car but got the hood. It’s gorgeous!pic.twitter.com/qqro802PXm

That’s what I’m saying Otis. Don’t listen to this other guy.

My Model 3 was also the most expensive (sticker priced) car I’ve ever purchased. But these aren’t just cars anymore... with FSD + Tesla Network, they become potentially something much better. And the sticker price also does not tell the whole story.

Sure, Tesla will kick Porsche's sad ass... but the Taycan will still win the paint whorl contest!!

@ elonmusk I was gifted this for Christmas but don't think I will ever go. Do you want to trade for a Tesla model X? pic.twitter.com/16xMcQOpTg

This is no a @ tesla competitor, but maybe one for the masses and push for further policy reform for mass EV uptake in Australia. A very decent EV given the price and will beat the equivalent priced ICE car | https://myelectriccar.com.au/hyundai-main/hyundai-kona/ …

And there’s @ TheMERL of ‘look at this absolute unit’ and ‘Show us your best duck.’ fame. # Unitmania reached its peak when Elon Musk changed his twitter profile in honour of the unit and then headhunted the museum’s Social Media guy to work for Tesla. https://twitter.com/TheMERL/status/1219186245034749952 …

Sigh, I am afraid you are correct. Although I think they may rethink their position over the next few weeks as this stock starts to correct and they lose actual hard earned dollars. I don't see a lot of positive catalysts for Tesla the next few quarters.

Thx. Total amount cars sold in 2019 was around 77 million. You don’t expect Tesla to sell >50 million cars in 2025, so you expect total amount will drop sharply regarding ICE vehicles. How many vehicles you expect to be sold 2025?

Jack owns stock in Tesla so of course he’ll let it go

Car batteries have a useful second life as stationary storage for renewable energy. And after that they can be fully recycled and turned into new battery materials. Watch what Tesla is doing on this front.

I’m not sure how much they update older vehicles I expect just major patches. So call it 3 versions as HW2 & 3 get regular small updates. But I guess you need to read up on Tesla...all features are live on Ghost mode on every vehicle learning and working removing such testing.

It’s dumb is what it is. Dumb to spend the money on a Taycan, even dumber to attempt to go on a road trip with it. Tesla is the clear winner, like @ chamath says, the lazy decision is to pick the winner and go with it.

The keyword is "probably", which is highly improbable, given the fact that the experience in this segment is significantly large and it is possible to avoid previous mistakes.

Tesla will certainly be the catalyst for EV growth. EV's will not replace ICE for a long, long time if ever. Growth doesn't extrapolate into world dominance. At this pace it just means the EV space may by 1 or 2% of total autos in a decade or so. Again EV sales declined in 2019

look at individual aspects. Yes, 5 = 5, great job. Look at individual tests. Front crash front passenger side is 4/5. Rollover test is 4/5. Model 3 has 5/5 for both. 4 < 5, twice. There’s not an argument lol, the Model 3 is simply safer.

Has it? 2019 escape began producing sometime in 2018(I’m guessing, if I’m wrong tell me). Overall it has the same safety rating. But look at the individual tests, and the recommended safety technology. It shows that the Model 3 is the safer car.

Yeah! Exactly that I didn’t hate tonight’s and the tesla one but this week I caught myself trying really hard to remember what was the one after orphan 55 that was so bad that was the reason I remembered took me 2 days to remember that it was the tesla so im like hm not sure yet

In a situation where self-defense is called for, I'd rather have 8 rounds of .45 ACP than 16 rds of 9mm. And on another note: John Moses Browning was one of the greatest inventors in history. On a level with Nicola Tesla, imo.

This is totally a letter from GM to Tesla. It reads like this: Dear Elon; STFU. Love, Mary.

If Tesla makes cars cheaper, improves perf, range, longevity, software features & UX that customers want, who cares about luxurious expensive leather? Expensive leather is an easy upgrade. Vertically integrating hardware and software and making the ecosystem sing, not so much.

This makes any range warranty useless. If a battery or range of batteries has issues then Tesla can apply a selective software patch - as they have done! - to cap charging and point to the fine print to deny warranty coverage.

I understand, but the price of the batteries is the limiting factor and the euro industry did nothing for the past 100 years to reduce it. But now with China and Tesla the price is going down a lot. The Volkswagen e-up is today at 23 440€ before incentives

I think tesla fans trashed is so hard because the specs did not match what they said it would be. 270kW < 350kW 150k > 75k 200miles < 300miles

Bitcoin is going to be pumped like Tesla stock because Elon and friends is buying it (not on his name of course). That and the fact that almost every big top500 tech company is building on EEA. Not to mention the virus, that somehow might push BTC and gold up.

Depends. On the open road yes. For city freeways, I find that at least for now, gotta really focus.

Tesla is the safest actually

Volvo is up there only because of the engine fires on the 4-cylinder diesel produced between 2014-2019. Other than that it's the safest after Tesla.

Bruh you should change you oil. 240,000 miles is a lot with no oil change. Probably should check your radiator and sparkplugs too Also at 240,000 miles you'd have saved around $36,000 in fuel costs New Tesla battery $5,000-7,000 But they also last way longer than 150,000 miles

I’m happy if Tesla keeps premiums, just as iPhones do. Healthy margins, and frankly, I’m not interested in those which cover low margin business. Let that take whoever succeeds.

I have been saying this for a year now. Tesla is its direct competitor, yet it doesn’t seem to concern. Once giga 1, 3, and 4 fully operate, which could be as soon as 2023, Tesla would be making 1.5-2 million cars. It would steal more than 30% sale from BMW. 2025 - death for BMW.

Elon said after April/2019 all cars coming with 3.0

Data shows that the 2019 Ford Escape is less safe than the Model X. And there aren’t exact numbers but there’s a decent chance that more people own the Model X than the 2019 Ford Escape, and the Model X has been around much longer, possibility accounting for more complaints

Elon Musk Q4: “[It’s] mind blowing I think. Yes. Coming out later this year, end of the year probably, that’s our goal. Get powertrain up [by] end of the year and then it’s going to be like — this is like alien technology, it’s insane. …Tesla is all about hardcore engineering.”

How has Tesla not produced a Rotodyne drone for commercial deliveries? Coupled with AI it could save billions in logistics through power and safety. NO DJI

Agreed, analyst have no idea what this Tesla platform enables. Akin to iPhone in 2007 - Jobs: “No App Store, dumb idea.” 2008 - Jobs: “Yes App Store” and rest is history. I was in App Store launch, too soon!

Fugitive > Praxeus > Orphan 55 > Tesla > Spyfall 1 >>>>> Spyfall 2 bumped Fugitive up bc that Sheffield Steel convinced me it has more 'about-ness' than I gave it credit for

The thing that bothers me though, the ones we have? Well I lived in NM in the time Tesla was talking about building plant there. One of the lesser known things is was Los Alamos going to be able to maintain the weapons. That was offensive to the population.

My favourite quote from Tesla's 2019-Q4 update: "Due to ramp of Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, production will likely outpace deliveries this year." My reading of this is that all undelivered vehicles will go towards Tesla's announced car sharing service. Exciting!

Will not disagree that Tesla is the standard for EV's. How can you demonstrate it is not a niche product? Why can it not continue growth less subsidies? Why is it cutting prices to sell cars if demand is so great? This isn't a Tesla is the leader discussion. Valuation is question

Thus Tesla gets into the weather biz using all their roofs (future) to create the best weather production model, beating out IBM/Weather.com.

They have tons of cash on hand and spending or leveraging deposits is a dangerous practice. When they are estimating production needs, a high deposit translates to reliable orders. Now they just want to sell as many premium trims as possible with no hurdles.

And he has a Tesla Model X, I thought he is having some exotic or super cars like Bugatti/Ferrari/McLaren/Koenigsegg

That’s funny about someone unplugging. I know the Tesla port locks when charging. It you bought the Audi e-tron, great! If still trying to decide what make then google the Tesla supercharging network in North America. Check out how fast the charging is.

I think part of the problem is sunk investment in plant equipment making 3.5L 300hp engines. So it should come from Tesla or similar companies, but I gueess they want 100% EV or nothing for vision and marketing reasons.

Hyundai can only go forward and back. # TSLA has been driving to us owners for the last year wherever you are, the little amazing trick hyundai has accomplished, tesla has been doing for years

Thanks for that. It’s a QC issue that was overlooked—apparently final QC checks are done in factory and not at the dealerships anymore. It’s going to be realigned and we were given a loaner.

According to Tesla’s website, Tesla only accepts trade ins at delivery. If this is accurate (a big if for this lying sack of shit co), then I’m going with: Customer takes delivery; still has unfettered right to return. Tesla books trade in as deposit until right to return ends.

Basically, Praxeus shows Series 12 is farther down the road to reinventing how to do Dr Who. Like Tesla, it'd be middling in a Tennant or Capaldi series ranking. And I'd like more weirdness. Bigger premises. But I'm really thrilled that this era has finally mastered the basics.

Are you sure it wasn’t the roofing co who wronged her? Tesla’s only mistake was to offer to work with roofing company. Tesla did not do roofing at that point. It’s like if I bought shoes that broke and I fell down on 5th Avenue in NYC and then sued the city because they have $$$

I think they are going to partially share the production lines for Model 3 & Y, they’ll be making them based on orders. So it’ll basically depends on incoming orders.

Revenue with loss doesn’t matter either. The only important arguments are market share and profit. Tesla is driven by hope and emotions, not by usability and quality. The hydrogen economy will unfortunately kill the hope and I doubt that emotions alone will carry the venture.

Good clarification. As rule says “It must have positive reported earnings in the most recent quarter, as well as over the four most recent quarters.” If Tesla reports Q1 Net Income of more than $160million it could be added to S&P500 in Q2 when S&P does its quarterly rebalancing.

I think Porsche and Tesla have different approaches to making an electric car, Porsche will have to take a more cautious approach to r&d and will have a more classically production ready car, Tesla seem to treat their vehicles as working r&d prototypes

Hi. This has nothing to do with ethical user interfaces but thanks for the comment I guess. Also: I am not short Tesla via common stock or options or any other vehicle.

# DoctorWho So going back to Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror and the not!Racnoss - there were parallels to earlier episodes again tonight and the Doctor is. Not. Seeing. Them. And I think there's a reason. I'm not sure what that IS yet.

Climate change doesn't care whether a vehicle is a personal car or not. We need to get rid of business ICE vehicles as well. Tesla is trying to accelerate the transition of the entire stack horizontally and vertically, from solar panels to energy storage to lorries. Rightly so.

Having now been able to *sit* in a Tesla and look at one in detail, I can easily see where the excitement and hype are. I hella want one.

if they were doing nothing, would have been a huge panic. if they do a lot, it s not good. This is a pattern with mainstream media. No matter what you do is a reason to panic . And someone, coincidentally controlling it, will capitalize heavily.

Why would we worry? It most likely means that Tesla just isn’t planning on repeating its crazy end of quarter delivery pushes, when it depletes inventory. Thus a reasonable inventory will be maintained , that means production needs to somewhat exceed deliveries.

It was ok. On the same level of Nikola Tesla’s Night of Terror. 6.5/10.

Yes, and it's not just Tesla. It's any system using vision and radar, and probably lidar too. Tesla is simply more visible because of the number of their vehicles in use and high profile. Their accidents make the news.

I don't know how much energy the computer actually uses, not just AP but also BMS and other general tasks but I would think that it actually uses a good amount of energy (range). Especially since AP is always running at least in shadow mode.

It had a radar cross section similar to a human, and so also to deer of some size and position (facing the car, crossing, etc.). To the radar it could have been a deer. If we put a deer image on the box, we would learn whether Tesla vision is trained for them as well as humans.

Of course the ability to travel underground in your Tesla eliminates the need for road infrastructure leading to trillions saved worldwide, subsidies for Boring Tesla’s would likely exceed the asking price leading to unlimited demand. New target: $1/0 in this case.

Look at my profile... I'll be mixing in my own pictures with the others I have collected.

No doubt there are still many hurdles and many risks faced by both companies, but never have I see 1 man achieve so much, and achieve things that are seemingly impossible. I'm skeptical by default. But it's hard to ignore the achievements, and I think success is more likely now.

Doesn't matter. The framing works. It's either a Tesla or a"car".

Are there scenarios that the cars have not seen before that you could use help with from Tesla drivers? Many people are more than willing to help. For example can the program accurately detect and avoid a trashcan being blown around in the middle of a road?

What some think is the biggest fraud of our time in corporate accounting. My back of the envelope calculation is at least $3b misaccounted. With correct accounting, I believe $ TSLA would have lost $2B more and been cash-flow negative in 2019.

There is no disputing Tesla is the North American king of Electric. Yet why not reference EV sales in China.? This has become the most important market for Tesla. What is their market share and growth in China?

One of the largest bubbles of our time or the breakthrough of our generation. Time will tell. My tip is on the former, but I know that given Musk's ambitions, I would not exclude the latter either.

Tesla is on an ever upward trajectory. The early Model 3’s had fit and finish problems. They long ago massively improved the quality. This guys comments are probably accurate against the early car Ford tore down.

Exactly.

Possible short on Tesla if their new factory gets closed due to virus.

But - and here's the important part - this means that 90% of the press about him is jokes and snark rather than a harsh indictment of tesla labor conditions, of its monopoly on the solar energy scene, of Musk's personal proclivity for spending his infinite wealth cutting poor

I think the point is that even if true, it is not entirely clear cut that they would be considered fraud. It's not a black and white situation. These things are often in various shades of grey. Even if the shade of grey is very dark, it's still not black and white.

In terms of # AI, we are no where near true AI, which evolves without human intervention (coding). The Basic AI, if you even can call it AI, is dependent on code input and it is as flawed as the code that it is being fed. Besides, AI requires appropriate HW to work properly.

Dann wird dich deine Frage hoffentlich nicht mehr allzu lange beschäftigen

You call it that, but that's not what it is.

The only people that completely know for sure are Tesla and the people holding it up That was the best info that was unearthed by folks on the owners group after considerable effort. Tesla never comment.

Do marketers play a key role in Tesla company like engineers?

Fresh from lending Queen Greta his Tesla, I notice Arnie rocked his flat top into Kitzbuhel for the Hahnenkamm. No doubt he walked there, the big square headed fraud

Model X you have to use two hands on each side and push HARD.

Take it easy on Roy, he probably is not tuned in to $ TSLAQ. Prob only got propaganda. W/3k followers not sure you will get attention, but keep it up and make sure @ elron is used. Tie it down and take it to the dealership, hope that is your only issue Roy.

Lets assume the proportion of AR is proportional to auto sales. So of the 1.3B, 1.1B is from auto. $1.1B = 17% of Q4 auto revenues. We know that Tesla does an end of Q push every Q. What percentage of cars are delivered in the last wee?

Tesla varsa olayda ,deney kesin yapılmış olmalı,ancak Einstein bu deneye karşı çıkmış ve organizasyon durmuş. Diye biliyorum.

Sure, that's why it's called "securities fraud", because legislators want names of crimes to be misleading.

Not profitable from operations. No real FCF. In 2019 Q4's profit was the result of ZEV credit sales. For the year Tesla lost money for the 16th year in a row and short-term liabilities increased 900 milllion. Subtract 900 million and ZEV credits and you have neg FCF from ops.

Toyota spending 13bn in r&d while tesla only 1/10 of that seems like a huge pro toyota talking point while it's everything wrong with the world and why we have little progress. It's the output to input ratio that matters not the input itself.

@ elonmusk Why has TESLA uk stopped allowing battery capacity unlocks on the 60D to make them 75D? Was a major selling point to be able to unlock it later when finances allowed. Very disappointed to say the least. Yet TESLA appears to be unlocking them at resale on used inventory.

Tesla had some tough patches as well, hope VW conquers theirs.

Fan blade rims on some Tesla's look like it could take flight. Years ago biwing plane stunt... Wondering. Tesla with drone capability's.

Yes I am sure. After the bubble blasts, Tesla will be history. Maybe already this year when more people understand what we are building now in Europe, China, Japan and probable the US too!

@ elonmusk how is the # coronavrius effecting @ Tesla in China?

Yes, but Tesla also operates its own dealerships/sales points. So its account receivable to revenues ratio should resemble other auto dealers - with a few days of DSO. Tesla's is more like ~20 days. This was a point made by @ davidein in his letter to Musk. Thank you.

@ elonmusk Tesla audio is great but for some it’s never enough! Can we get provisions in Cybertruck for easier audio installs? Access to channels and holes for wire runs, including into the doors, and clean audio signal from the “headunit?" CT power should be enough as is tho

Not only exceeds anything else in volume production but also is crucial for solving autonomous cars which once more consolidates Tesla on the leading spot in race to full self driving

Anyone in the Bay have a used Tesla model x bike rack

Tesla's potential to use AI is limitless. Apple for example uses AI for palm rejection on touch pads, palm rejection while using apple pencil on iPads, safari uses AI to make it harder for websites to track users. A lot of these use cases don't jump out as being AI candidates.

If you are referring to upgrades, I think it has nothing to do with apple or Google. Mine says pay with credit card, I believe it uses the same cc you have on file for supercharger credits. I dont think Tesla pays a penny to apple or Google as the transaction is outside the app.

Probably because the eye watering cost of Tesla's in NZ would max out anyone's credit card. Even the deposit.

@ elonmusk @ thirdrowtesla @ Kristennetten It's a super good feeling being so heavily invested in @ Tesla right now. In 10-15 years it will be like as if John Spartan from Demolition Man had gone all in on YUM (Taco Bell) before he was cryogenically frozen. $ tesla pic.twitter.com/ULmfpnZm6q

It doesn't matter if Tesla has orders of magnitude more than everyone w.r.t self driving. What matters if there is a robust system with redundancies to protect society from your AI experiment.

But you already claimed that every car built by Tesla after October 2016 had all the compute power needed for FSD/Level 5 driving. You were wrong then, how do you know you aren't wrong this time?

No, that’s impossible, all of it! My @ Tesla M3, the AutoPilot, the SuperCharger network, even⁩ the # ImpossibleWHOPPER eaten at this SC! My fIrst ⁦ @ BurgerKing⁩ purchase in 15 years. An impossibly smart pairing in Holbrook, AZ. See # GameChangersMovie @ LeilaniMunter⁩pic.twitter.com/AEIjwRIHNY

Unfortunately the original tweet did not start off using the normal protocol of “we love the car but.” Your next best option is petitioning Twitter for a blue checkmark. Or changing your name to Taleb.

Yo también me apunto!! Ensaimada, sobrasada y Tesla, ouyeaaaa!!

Is Tesla going to redesign the model x that lost its 3rd row, when the gtr crashed into one?

Hey, I'm just charging my Tesla overnight on sunshine power, nerd. That's how electricity breaks our addiction fossil fuels.

I want a Tesla.

Elon you should OTA update all Tesla's to make their blinkers run off a universal clock based system so all Tesla's blinkers blink at the exact same time across the globe

Yes I'll travel to California to be clear if needed. I just do not want to live there. I lived in Davis for a while, I kinda like my isolation. Really I do know that's not normal for Tesla. But you give me a chance, I promise I'm worth it.

I see you're still intoxicated in fuel.

Pour Tesla, l'épreuve de vérité se jouera dans les usines http://getpocket.com/@antoinebrn/share/4654184 …

I can still clearly remember him saying, "We(Tesla) want to make an electric as compelling as possible, we put every penny into making a car as compelling as possible and nothing for marketing". I think this is a great strategy. For that kind of product tho'.

So if tesla ever goes haywire, they can basically take control of your vehicle whenever they want. Gotcha

“I don’t ever comment on the stock” “bro I doubled my investment in the stock.” You tesla bulls really are this dumb. I love it. How is Twitter free?!?!?!

You should also research Tesla’s sustainable growth rate. It’s been 56% since 2012, which is the fastest mfg growth in American history, including Ford in the 1900’s. With improved capital efficiency improving, they can increase that growth rate.

Yes!

I will certainly admit there will be some growing pains...

How much more efficient would driving be if every car on the road was a Tesla, each communicating with the other? Proper distance between all cars at all times, getting on and off freeways the proper way. No unnecessarily lame switching to halt traffic. Imagine.

Lol. You've been saying that for EVERY CAR TESLA PRODUCED since October 2016. Then you added more compute power last year, because you don't know what you are promising. You promised fully operational 1 million robotaxi fleet this year.

Players were talking about their tesla cars while they're not endorsed. It's not usual. Fact: Tesla spends zero for marketing. I think it's stunning how Musk communicates his vision. It gets to a point even customers feel responsible to buy the cars and yes promote em for free

Nah, just find a ticker with tiny float, reverse merger it into a new biotech focusing on face masks and shields. PR that company is working on masks with built in vaccines that are inhaled as you wear them. Get added to whatever dumb index will take you. Bam. Never work again

One hopes, Tesla's AI has better grammar than that...

Stockholders. As Tesla expands beyond its tiny market of a few hundred thousand customers, they won't all be part of the Religion and they'll expect, need and demand a reliable car with accessible affordable service. Tesla can't offer that.

As someone in ML/AI, you may recruit more talent if you allow your scientists to publish. We're seeing it more and more with Facbook AI, Disney Research, etc I consider Tesla as one of the top tech companies, but hard to know for certain because we don't see much of the work.

You're being sarcastic right? Because there are a lot of remedial jobs at Tesla.

Yes, I’ve read about it. Not sure if and when this will be made universal for everyone. Here in Iowa, it’s all about ethanol production, and pushing wind and solar for power. Lots of jobs would be lost with the Tesla energy here in the Midwest.

Fatality rate of flu is 0.01% . In this case of novel coronavirus its 2-3% that's 200 to 300 times more deadly than flu. Flu causes arround 650,000 deaths per year. If this spreads like flu then millions will be dead. It will take atleast 10-12 months to develop any vaccine.

Yes, but still corruption cancels any good deed. Not everyone works for a company that offers a 401K or if they do, do not qualify b/c they only work PT. I'm not complaining, my IRA has increased. Currently I'm kicking myself in the butt for not getting Tesla stock last Feb.

“excuse me, waiter... yes, I ordered the pie...”

I agree, problem is I have young kids who play out and around there all the time so I don't think it's an option. Best guess is the unusual Florida cold spell in early Jan led to this. Normally the garage would be too hot and last place a rodent would head.

Most rational people would take these claims, presented to people as 'fact' by Chanos or his firm, and chuck them up for what they probably really are, which were mistakes. But if a mistake can be construed as a lie, then he must be considered a fraudster.

Does Tesla AI develop a NeuralNet solely for the purpose of FSD or do you have some more generalized purpose in mind?

Hi Gabriel, where do you get the smashed glass t shirt?

Y is fatter, has a hatch, and costs more. More importantly, how is this different from the non-production spec Model Y that Tesla has been already pumping for months?

it would have to be available at 4000$ to be able to buy it at 4000$ because for the moment it is still at 10500$

An accidental purchase could easily be undiscovered for weeks to months, and you'd never have even agreed to the 48-hour window as it was accidental. Ironically, it's in Tesla's interest to do this as it's truly pure profit, assume any judge will throw out but will they penalize?

An better analogy might be "Tesla stops sending software updates to your car, potentially jepordizing your safety (and possibly making your car no longer street-legal)." Telsa could also revoke software-only upgrades like Autopilot.

Of course not. It’s not even “a thing” in new electric cars. Tesla 500 Km. You can now drive coast to coast with Tesla Super chargers call across ..

All Tesla needs to do is add an authorization confirmation for purchase. Then owners can't complain it was an accidental purchase after what ever refund deadline Tesla wants to institute. The fact that they won't do this leads me to believe they're being disingenuous.

It may be a smoke screen who knows what they might be secretly working on. As far as Fiat Chrysler, Michael Manley last November talked about the possibility of partnering with Tesla on a skateboard platform. Since then nothing regarding that comment. Hmmm I wonder what’s brewing

Even my seven year old Model S got an update this week

I'm a big advocate of using renewable to produce hydrogen as a storage medium. It's possible to scale it but needs more research into catalysts. At the moment solar and wind are sucking up the funding and when it's dark and windless we have nothing.

So how did that Tesla short work out buddy? pic.twitter.com/J5regLv6pG

Well, because significant renewable penetration costs $$$, natural gas prices will not remain flat forever, and electrification of vehicles, appliances, water heaters, etc will drastically increase usage. More usage and higher rates equals higher electric bills.

You kissed the stock price lol

Home row fo LYFE! # ASDFJKL;

It doesn’t in the way you’re calculating. It’s an investment in vehicle experience, fundamental to value of the car. Tesla puts chargers in hyper convenient spots, which morphs functional to magical. Other OEMs don’t seem to appreciate/understand it’s a larger calculus.

Nou, dat is een kwestie van opletten en Tesla volgen. Al bij de presentatie, ik mocht erbij zijn, is al gezegd dat hij meer gaat verkopen dan S, 3 en X samen.

Why not?

Ist es wahrscheinlich, dass der Zeitplan von Tesla machbar ist noch alle Bäume zu fällen? Das Munitionssammeln dauert ja extrem lange.

You think Tesla is built better than a Toyota?

I think he is. Isn't he working on some crypto scam of his own?

Definitely using a block list. I’ve never interacted with this account before.

TSLAQ: Tesla is scammy, don't refund upgrade purchases. TSLA: We've gone ahead and done just that. And we will give you a 48 hr window, just in case you have buyers remorse. TSLAQ: But this doesn't fix my child doing accidental purchases. .. TSLA: You should have used protection.

@ elonmusk Hey Elevated Muskellunge, this is kinda a niche idea for Tesla, but would you ever consider wig-wag lighting for first responders that own a Tesla? I would imagine it would be simpler on a Tesla than most other cars. Just a thought.

Na 10 minuten doorgereden naar SC Gouda, en de Tesla vond het niet nodig om voor te verwarmen, dus dat kan niet de reden geweest zijn.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) surprised the market with Q3 result. Merrill Lynch changed the rating to Outperform, as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) reported a net revenue that soared 7%.

So what? They are supposed to get all of them right or make it right. The company is a disaster and it seems only stockholders have a good experience with them. Hmm.

I don’t think the market is pricing FSD/robotaxi into the stock at all. I just see it as a potential bonus item. My concerns are with things that can have a negative impact on the stock in the next 3-5 years. Tesla’s rate of innovation may be the key to it all.

All the fan boys & Tesla are ‘well aware’ ...

And the fact they don’t know me and know much I HAVE done for EV adoption and Tesla in general. I love EVs and Tesla but it isn’t practical for my work vehicle. I’m ok with saying that, EVs still have a lot of room to grow.

Again, what are your assumptions? If you assume electricity rates will remain flat for 25 years, usage will remain flat for 25 years, it’s about 12 years. As someone who works in the electric utility industry, I don’t share those assumptions...

You spent $60k on a sedan and didn't know the company is run by a fraud and pathological liar and they make shitboxes with non existant service? Good luck! I hope you have a back up car.

Your insurance is expensive? Mine is 65 a month. For example, my other cars are 120 a month. EVs, especially tesla, are suppose to be less expensive than other vehicles. Curious which car insurance you have?

Sure, it gets old hearing from Tesla fans how I’m killing their children, killing the environment and on and on. Meanwhile they continue to drive their expensive EVs thinking they are perfect and doing all they can, which isn’t the case. It’s just what they are comfortable with.

yeah thanks for letting me use your tesla a couple days ago

It's over $33k with California has prices. That's nearly the cost of a Tesla model 3!

Awe I have a soft spot for JLR, lived nearby, had a few mates work there, and before Tesla came along i loved their cars. Hope they crack EV.

And by the way I don’t own a car myself. I own a motorcycle which sadly isn’t electric but I don’t ride it that much anyway. At least it’s 50 mpg... When I can I take the train or carpool with friends or coworkers. When I move and feel the need to buy a car it will be a Tesla.

I had a dream that Tesla released a Model 3 wagon and now I can't stop thinking about it. Longer wheel base means potentially larger battery capacity, tons of storage, foldable back row. Nice family car but not as large as the X or Y... @ elonmusk any interest in a wagon?

Was thinking the same thing. Even with the types of theta curves inherent in Tesla options. Maybe he was buying short-dated vintages.

What´s the other car there ^^

To this point, many have thought that Tesla was the ONLY EV manufacturer. The fact that there are competitors that are advertising changes the dynamics. Everyone will have to step up there game, including Tesla.

Hope you get access to a car with HW3 for comparison. And a Taycan, e-tron and i-Pace as well.

Tesla owners use solar panels to charge their cars, and Tesla Superchargers are solar and renewable. Where else will they charge? But the real question is: why you would drive a rolling, poisonous-gas-emitting napalm bomb? That question had nothing to do with the grid.

Make them sweeten the pot with a new Tesla



I’d love to own an electric car, especially with recent performance improvements by @ Tesla and @ Ford. I think the only thing standing in the way is the current charging-station infrastructure. That coupled with ongoing government incentives will make the transition easy.

@ hulu I just got off the phone with José with your customer service. Give that man a raise, a promotion, a @ Tesla and a vacation to where ever he likes! Every company needs 100 of him. He helped me and was such a pleasure to speak with!!!

Smart officers who think about budgets would know that a Tesla has very, very, low operating costs, and is more reliable than an ICE vehicle, with better performance. The savings will pay for your auto insurance and leave plenty of cash in your pocket. ;)

Anyone want to make a side bet that Tesla closes in the green tomorrow??

Plug in è un motore a combustione venduto bene. Tesla ha la miglior tecnologia oggi disponibile per le auto elettriche e Musk da 0 è riuscito a vendere razzi a NASA. Ponzi scheme è una parola grossa

Right now politics is a car over correcting on an icy road and we need Tesla engineering to avoid the ditch.

You're probably going to put that Russian arm on the Tesla cybertruck, as you should!

If you are Tesla you own a cool

So you can’t just give an answer? Wonder why? Would be bad for tezzla shingles sales...?

VW ha venduto 140k plug-in EV nel 2019. Tesla e' un ponzi scheme, come tutto quello che fa Musk.

Tesla makes the safest cars on the road right now, they're nearly impossible to flip in an accident and are usually faster than most other cars on the road

Financial news networks treat Tesla like regular news networks treat Donald Trump. Like, can we learn about something else?

I feel like this is why if Tesla gets FSD approved it will be a hurdle because when it's around level 4 I believe where you just have to monitor the vehicle. They're will be individuals who don't that may get in a accident and blame it on the tesla instead of being cautious.

Dumb trade, I was short Tesla for like two months when Fintwit reached fever pitch anti-Tesla sentiment.

I see it like that: If I am wrong and emissions didn't lead to dangerous warming than we have at least clean air afterwards. Not just less CO2 but also other chemicals that are unhealthy should be reduced.

True (?!). But also impractical.

Does @ Tesla see what's coming on the left after stopping, then turning. Sure it sees the car in front of it. Needs some more awareness to either side before turning. # Tboned

Tesla is getting smarter normalizing the deposit/order process across all models. The 100 is now nonrefundable which makes refund administration easier. I would expect this to be the norm going forward and purchase settlement before shipping.

I think more research has to be done on the effects of emissions by humanity. There's still a hell of a lot "could lead to" and "may result in" written into the reports. Sometimes you need to angle the results to receive more funding and that I'm suspicious of.

Oui sans solution de recharge privée à domicile ou au boulot je ne m’y risquerais pas. Sauf peut-être avec une Tesla à condition d’avoir un supercharger pas trop loin, et encore, il paraît que les charges rapides trop fréquentes c’est pas l’idéal pour les batteries

100%. What I don't agree with is that extracting money from people and expecting renewables to meet the demand is achievable. It isn't. We need better tech developing like LFTR. We need to stop using single use products. Fruit and veg in paper bags and fizzy pop in glass...

Depends on your assumptions around electricity rates and electricity usage moving forward. If you’ve done research on energy usage, you’re aware that the proliferation of renewable energy is creating a push towards electrification. This will cut down payback times significantly.

Not true. Li ion is happiest when around 50% charged - and 90% to 20% in general. This is the reason most EV manufacturers, including Tesla, ask owners to charge the vehicles to no more than 90%.

I bought a 60 amp breaker. 25 feet of 6/3 wire and a 14-50 outlet to charge my Tesla for less then $80.

Sounds ambitious but this is way less fanciful than self driving technology. Tesla’s can already detect driving patterns and can be programmed, not hard to have sensors detect a few key indicators of impairment and to require confirmation from the driver.

Yet another thing BEVs will massively disrupt: farming. 40% of corn production in U.S. is used for fuel ethanol, valued over $20B/year. Fortunately, all that can shift to carbon capture, but we'll need Green New Deal investment to ride out the Tesla tipping point.

They should cover it under warranty. The article talks about "customers" and "teslas" but is this actually a common issue or is this one of those unfortunate and unique situations? Might explain, although not justify, why they are not covering it. They never saw it before.

Tesla produced about 105K vehicles in Q4 but delivered about 112K.

It’s actually avoided several accidents by braking early or moving away when someone else left their lane. I cannot imagine driving without it anymore.

You can’t call it a Revolution when Tesla created it 10 years ago.

I am not sure which idiots but # Porsche ?? # tesla is the best!!!!

Good point, but all Tesla can really do is skip to there, and just do a normal beat-em-up route. Einstein has his speed all the way through. (But alas, I won't argue with who you prefer.)

Why have you resorted to name calling. What you are talking about is surface sea temp. SST. This is the energy that is absorbed by the sea from the sun. Earlier you stated it has nothing to do with the sun. What I was taking about is the contribution of CO2.

Tesla is top of list but the price is not in its favor this go round.

Even at ~96K Q1 deliveries, Tesla could still “comfortably exceed 500K” deliveries in 2020, simply by ramping GF3 Model 3s and Fremont Model Ys to near 3K/wk each by Q4 + a few thousand Tesla Semi deliveries in the 2nd half.

2/2 But the truth is the most talented and driven people don’t want to work just for money. That isn’t fulfilling. They want to be on a mission and work for a leader that is just as talented and driven as them. That’s why Tesla and SpaceX succeed where others fail.

What the title of this article was supposed to say, "Buy As Much Tesla Stock as you can Right Now."

There are more than 17,000 car crashes every single day in the U.S. So if every single Tesla crash is in the news, that's a good thing because only rare or sensational things make the news. Autopilot is proving to be safer than a typical human driver.

Richtig, und obwohl Toyota vermutlich im Recht war haben sie die Schuld nicht auf die Kunden geschoben und wurden hart bestraft. Bei Audi kam die NHTSA damals zum Schluss, dass Gas und Bremse wenige mm zu dicht aneinander lagen. Es dauerte 15 Jahre bis Audi sich davon erholte.

The theories have been meticulously debunked. No fraud has yet to be actually uncovered, but even if you assume there is fraud, which you do, the market has shown many times that it doesnt much care. Every auto company except Tesla has had the stigma of fraud and none are BK yet.

This is why I bought a Tesla instead of having a child.

It was either on the q4 conference call or on the 3rd row podcast, but for sure was said. I believe it was on the q4 call though. I’ll find it again and post later. But it was said.

Ha. Not. Even. Close. The technology alone in a Tesla has higher value over any of these.

This is misleading. Tesla autodrive has a feature that the user must touch the wheel every few seconds in order for the autodrive to remain engaged. Tesla “recommends” keeping hand on the wheel. It requires touches to ensure you’re paying attention.

Because that kind of software is subject to stricter dev/qa standards. That makes the development cycle longer. So you can’t release after every little fix. What Tesla is doing is not a strength but weakness. They treat almost all software equally and sometimes brick cars.

All those whining people that call the police when somebody steals their property only show their weakness. If they want to prove they are better than others they should just get over it and go earn more! Obvsly tesla is behind, that's why others are stealing from them!

There’s no doubt that the Tesla semi, even without autonomy, will take the heavy trucking industry by storm. But half measures are not Elon’s style, nor should they be. Antonomy is close. Maybe imminent from the sounds of it.

Could you please build a car similar to model 3 with $5-10k cheaper and has two doors(less material cost)? doesn't need to be super powerful motor. like 0 to 60mph in 8-10 secconds range. shorter battery range around 250miles. I am a college student but can't afford Tesla

From my experience auditing car dealerships, trade ins are inventory because they have a used car dept and they resell those vehicles to customers in the normal course of business. Maybe Tesla treats trade ins as deposits because they don’t sell used cars to the public.

You are wrong. Tesla has been one of my most successful holdings and way too hot to short here. I haven't been purely long except for Dec and Jan but I have indeed been net delta long for most of the last half year. I will go short if Tesla can't hold 650 and breaks below 630,fyi

I’m happy about it too, but I’ve also been thinking about how much heavier they are, a Tesla is nearly 5,000 pounds. Are they actually going decrease survivability in ped/cycle/auto crashes?

Brings up interesting point: good driver asst features are useful to the owner and becoming ubiquitous to even entry level cars. Robotaxi is NOT useful to most owners and $60k sport/luxury car is impractical for application. 3rd party tech = to Tesla for drive asst. 1/2

This is truly amazing! It is most interesting to see the right-hand turn. It seems to have already populated what it's about to encounter, before it completes the turn. @ Tesla

This also ignores state level incentives. The MA incentive was recently restarted and gives back an additional $2500. Also he mentions this in the article but Tesla has BMW / Porche level performance & tech and the Civic is... a Civic. https://youtu.be/7bIBs8GuUYY

Yes! We also tend to take it on longer road trips, so it's the car that's getting the most use. I get ~31 mpg on average. We really want our next cars to be electric. Sat in a Tesla in Houston a couple weeks ago and it was so cool. I think Volvo is going all electric, too!

Probably a good play. NIO’s most recent high was $5.02. I think they can exceed it especially with how well Tesla has been doing.

Sure, but Tesla can sell the non-FSD version of the trucks and keep its advantage in that industry if it chooses to enter it one day. Autonomy is still a far-flung sci-fi concept for the rest of the industry. Electric itself would be a great selling point for these trucks.

Welp, people are adults and they can make up their own minds. You should stick to advising your clients. I believe you started this thread saying you don't know much about autonomy but Tesla is losing because they are spending as much. You shouldn't advise based on that alone.

Sure. But in order to short you need to first buy the shares. How will that happen? And how do you connect your liquidity to the dropping short interest to the regular financial world? It is not smart to short Tesla and even less smarter to short it on synthetix.

this exact same framing is why Tesla routinely has people shorting it for "gains", effectively betting against the users and developers...this is true in all speculative markets... people "shorting" are betting "against" developers, users, and the organization itself

AS BEST THEY CAN??? You are joking right?

Yes I see very little differentiation in the model and it will be simply a personal choice but not a significant utilitarian one. I think 3 proved something in taking away sales from s. Tesla buyers just want a Tesla and will go with cheapest one.

I don’t know. Elon Musk and Tesla built their Gigafactory in China in months to better specs than the one in California and Nevada that literally took years. China gets shit done. America has the craziest regulations that makes us slow compared to the rest of the world.

Would be ironic if Tesla has less competition than SpaceX

Apple is the opposite of vertically integrated. They don't even manufacture their devices! They don't own the wireless companies (~ equivalent to charging stations). This is why Tesla can't scale- even if they had demand.

And surprise I bought you a tesla

That boost in price will be well worth It and it still won’t be outrageous compared to lambo’s, rolls royce’s bmw’s and Even Mercedes. And these are top tier gas vehicles. The Tesla is already better than them as of now so that price will bring you more.

That’s a good take, however, I don’t imagine this happening until Tesla is taking over the gas car economy by majority. Elon sells these Tesla’s at an affordable rate, just so that they can be mass produced and everyone can have one. Leading to 100% electric cars.

Warrantying to 70% isn't really that great, especially given people's experience with other lithium ion devices like phones. If the crowdsourced number is 90%, how about 85%. Tesla has better data on this & what causes some users to experience worse performance.

I’m not convinced that replacing this is Tesla’s goal. I enjoy integration of my Tesla with my Apple based ecosystem, but atm there’s not a platform within the Tesla ecosystem supplying a similar set of services. Compare it to Nintendo’s Switch ecosystem which is good on its own.

The problem is that it spreads very easy, therefore, a lot of people will be infected, also people with poorly immune system. That’s the main issue. Healthy people won’t have big issue being infected, but they will spread it to people who can die if they get it.

Hey @ russ1mitchell , I’d love to call you and discuss my “bone-chillingly” amazing experience with Tesla solar. Heck, come by the house and I’ll walk you through my solar and power wall system.

$ TSLA because China suppliers are not providing new ship dates due to China New Year extension. So if Tesla mfg shuts down there is no restart date. This uncertainty of restart date needs to get priced in. So market will become very distorted and irrational.

@ elonmusk when are you going to make a Tesla Mini Bus? Would love to see one in the near future. AWD and lots of plugs for some camping trips.

Una Tesla la puoi benissimo pagare sui 200/300.000$. Il suo ciclo di vita è dettato dalla batteria che è “garantita” 8-10 anni. Con quella cifra può comprarsi benissimo un Maserati GT Sport per 150.000€ e col risparmio può anche tenere acceso il motore per 10 anni

Tesla should show physically in there stores with what people can charge their future ev... Home Charger... The Super Charger outside but also the “Mobile Charger” that you can plug in everywhere... People hear and read horror stories about charging and range...

Why not bash @ TatamotorsEV ? They have tested this car for over 1 million kms. Am sure they the know the real world range and still put 300 kms on the boards. Why not say real world range is this and arai is 312. Tesla does that so should others too.

That's the best way. And safest. You can never have your own gas station at home tho you know lol. And I enjoy charge time. You see if tesla didn't have the big screen with Netflix and the sound system, yes charging woukd suck. But it's quite pleasing. Plus you can explore more.

As a newly-minted Tesla owner, I would say that, so far, the value vs. feature set is incomparable. With the other brands, you'll get a nice, refined experience that will rarely update paired with mediocre range. With Tesla, you can ever-evolving car experience.

Tesla didn't "singlehandedly" anything, EVs were coming. Spurring on an existing thing could count as positive, but is negated by selling the credits. Polluting by proxy is still polluting. Plus there's no sustainability: Tesla treats its cars as disposable – they're toxic waste.

Plus there's only like one or 2 charging stations at each location. Seriously. I will never buy a gas car again and the only car I'm buying next is a Tesla based on my experience with the Leaf with range and charging.

This is the most delicious irony. Tesla wouldn't exist without govt subsidies and political virtue signaling. But it will also be those same subsidies and mandates for other OEMs that bring on the massive competition that will inevitably be the downfall of Tesla.

Sounds a good idea in principle, but OEM's don't have facilities to make EV's. Their facilities are all set up to make ICE/Diesel and are in long term deals using that model and Tesla cant make more than 1m a year. So think it will be a few years yet before it turns around.

Why didn't you lease? I've driven the VW e-golfs for the past 4 years with zero issues. I typically get 135 Mi of range and the egolf fits my needs perfectly. Sorry you had the problem I'm sure VW will resolve it or if not you cam take advantage of the Lemon Law in your state.

Just watched the Tesla episode of # WhoviansAU. The Vincent moment is one of the best moments of # DoctorWho . I was hoping for a more happier ending for Tesla, like he did invent that big thing everyone uses now... then remembered it’s based on real history aaand was sad.

The Tesla community needs to be honest about range - the advertised range is a joke if you live somewhere with hills, weather and traffic. Great car but stop trying to fool consumers. I love mine but gimme a break.

But the Leaf is fun to drive besides the range and I'm never buying gas again. Plus Nissan did pay in 2011 for the full install of my EVSE which was about $1k. And the Leaf was around $28k after incentives and it was the ONLY non Tesla EV when I bought it. Besides the Mitsubishi.

The surge is a loud and clear statement to the world that Tesla EV's are at the forefront of this evolution and its the car to own. No one is close to them, they are pulling away and if you believe EV's are the future, Tesla is the play. Couldn't agree more Value, very positive.

I’m a huge Tesla fan, but I’ve also loved Hyundai since I first saw your cars in 1984. You take the best of Korea and make it a American for our tastes. Wish the Montgomery tour wasn’t so hard to schedule.

If $ TSLA can sell EV at 20%+ margin, they could support other manufacturers via licensing deals to do same. Everyone else loses money on EVs. It’s quickest way to flip 80 mill ICE sales per year to EV, and # Tesla could take day 1-2% gross revenue on those sales with zero cost.

Giving them a pass to pollute "supports big oil." The $$ is immaterial, what matters (or is supposed to) is cutting back on pollution. By taking their $$, Tesla is polluting by proxy. Also, EVs are dirtier to manufacture, toxic to dispose of, and Tesla treats them as disposable.

companies borrow money all the time, so what? Tesla borrowed from local banks to finance GF3 expansion on favorable terms. It’s positive for the Company and for the stock. Semi it’s coming. Will be another smash hit. I a have a feeling in Q4 2020 we will see 2b free cash flow.

This company's new technology threatens electric vehicles. Cars like those offered by Tesla boast ranges of 250-300 miles on a single charge. With Blue Gas cars, 300 miles is the low end of the range a driver will get. # elonmusk https://www.outsiderclub.com/tesla-s-downfall-is-coming/94862 …pic.twitter.com/aRjhkqJpXm

Accounting fraud is Tesla’s biggest competitive advantage.

Exactly! It defaults to selecting the checked box. I keep trying to unselect it and it reverts back to checking the box. Then it’s so easy for people to simply press pay & most of us have a credit card on file with Tesla to pay for supercharging. Hmmmm psychological technique?

Why do you assume that Tesla has to share anything with EXISTING markets? Elon would be FAR better off donating a sh*t ton of money towards a pool, in an effort to start entirely new auto industries as fair competition.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) surprised the market with Q4 result. Goldman Sachs changed the rating to Outperform, as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) reported a net revenue that soared 7%.

Extreme cold can damage the batteries, but keeping the charge on over night will prevent freezing. E-heating is major waste. Tesla should install nat gas interior heater for the Canadian customers to extend milage.

Not sure if this fits in any of those categories but there’s also a feedback loop involving Tesla’s on road, their performance vs other cars, & impressions made. For example, acceleration at highway on ramps, at lights changes, road handling - drivers of other cars witness these.

There is very limited effect in using stock buy/sell actions to force a company to fail, or succeed for that matter. The fraud claims have about run out of effect. Relative to @ Tesla success trajectory, they’ll have as much effect as passing through a cloud.

What I DO see (that feels like it’s -generally- a good thing), is mainstream folks becoming more aware of Tesla as brand & in what they’re doing. Hear it & see it more in friends/neighbors/business around town. If he plays a role in that, seems generally a good thing all I meant

Yes. Maybe even identify crashes with the autopilot cameras, send it to the fleet so other Tesla's will be routed around the traffic jam

Und wenn wir nicht endlich konsequent in eine H2 Wirtschaft transformieren, wird es noch viel schlimmer werden, denn dann entsteht eine all-Electric Wirtschaft, in der die EVU quasi ein Monopol haben! Firmen wie Tesla, RWE etc. wollen das natürlich. Wir zahlen!

Thanks — now what if I already did that though

These short sellers proclaim fraud, and that Tesla will go to 0. In the meantime, they also protect their short positions using Buy-limit orders and Call options to minimize losses when TSLA stock keeps going up. If they truly believed their short, why buy protection?

Check out the actual warming figures. none. It's stopped for quite sometime. That's why they changed to "climate change" you can't claim global warming when the figure shows there is none but you can claim climate change because we don't have good records of past climate

He has aerospace and auto experience and is impressed with their electronics design which obviously come from the "SpaceX side" of Tesla.

We all enjoyed poking fun at # Taycan, but ultimately want to see end of ICE, & # Tesla can’t sell 80 million cars a year. With competition so far behind, at some point @ elonmusk will have to considering licensing $ TSLA tech to other manufacturers. Win win, quicker to goal line.

In fact, I know there is a Thiel video (can't find it) where he says that @ Tesla is an example of great human coordination/execution - but not pure innovation, since all the technology exists. I found this surprising, but hey, he's the tech billionaire.

Graham also gets free pass to use a literal death ray in "Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror" (it doesn't work but no-one seemed to actually know that until they tried firing). At this point, the show's gun stance seems to be "Never use guns - unless you're Graham"

No it's not more likely, or else you can see every major automaker completely smashing it in the EV market. yet all of their EVs more or less suck in comparison to Tesla. Why is that? They have so much money!

No it’s not. This is the argument some small minority people pushed 15-20 years ago. Totally debunked. I’m leaving this thread, you can’t beat liars in bad faith.

I agree with @ jpr007 100%. I own 15-20 stocks but 4 of those stocks make up 90% of my portfolio. Tesla was 20% but has grown to 30%. I have been with TMF since they convinced me to buy NFLX in 2007. I agree with most of their investing philosophies but I like a little more...

I traded both runs -- believe me, TSLA going much higher. Hop on for the ride. One mistake I made was not riding QCOM all the way to the top. Won't happen with Tesla.

Yep. The logical strategy for the OEMs was always "wait and see" as battery prices fell and Tesla proved there was a market (maybe) for EVs. Because Tesla never has had a tech moat to prevent this type of catch up. The Teslemmings mistook this delay for a tech advantage.

@ elonmusk, I love Tesla’s mission & am fascinated with the products. Applied to 3 positions at GF4 but haven’t heard back for 2 months. I’m a project manager, worked in logistics planning at BMW, and am German & English native speaker. Super motivated to help build and run GF4!

Dave, agree - ARK’s robotaxi fleet numbers too optimistic. But think Tesla can get close to 3M vehicles - apply Musk’s 50% growth rate. Seems possible..no? 19 - 367K Giga N 20 - 551K Giga N+S 21 - 826K Giga N+S 22 - 1,240K Giga N+S+B 23 - 1,860K Giga N+S+B 24 - 2,790K Giga N+S+B

I wrote Tesla about the ambassador idea and that I’d be giving as many rides until then. I’m amazed everyday how many people have no idea that the future is here. Special moment in automotive history.

True. But people need to learn to live more frugally. I do and I don't need to. The vast majority of Americans don't save $ even when they can do so (when they have income). :O/

All the points you've made are generic and apply to any comp in any industry, it's meaningless.. if they doubled r&d you'd say they're investing in the future, it's down so you say they're being efficient. Elon could take a dump in a box and you would think it was good for tesla

I really don't think it's a big issue, and Tesla is very much aware of it and working towards better Solutions , so I would say congratulations on owning the electric car! I am looking forward to getting mine someday!

We don't actually have that data but from ice core samples it would appear at times it happens over very short period of time. 10's of years rather than 1000's. What needs to be researched is what caused the rapid changes. Volcanoes, meteor strikes etc

I dont think Ark is taking battery constraint into account. Does Ark know something about battery production that we dont? We will see at battery investor day how fast Tesla can ramp, but until that point, vehicles/batteries will continue to limit growth this fast for all EVs

But isn't this the whole point? Sustainability on every level. It's what Tesla's all about + being subsidy free = greater freedom & flexibility to move & grow.

Yes. My Tesla S could go 475km on a charge (theoretically as I never take it down to zero for the health of thebatteru) and has an 85kWh battery. 85x.$07= $5.95 cost/ charge bottom to top. $60/$5.95=10.08 charges. 10.08 x 475km= 4,790 km... round up to 5000km on $60

How old are you? In old enough to remember all the bad things that were predicted and none have come to fruition over the decades. It's now like the boy who cried wolf. Climate change has always happened like the land mass has always moved. Don't you know that? Scientific fact.

Edison gave traveling magician Tesla a chance, and since he happened to be "working" on Edison's AC motor concept, Westinghouse hired him and created a patent so he could build the dam in Niagara Falls that has been Edison's dream.

Agreed. Ironically it could be better for BMW to pay a hefty penalty by selling high margin ICEs and wait for improved BEV technology (mainly batteries). The “low demand” is mainly due to skewed auto mfgs portfolio. Current BEV have better drivetrains than any ICE and lower TCO.

On a recent 500ml UK and 700ml trip through France that would have added a fair bit to an already long journey. Plus Tesla superchargers were nearly always full in the service areas, meaning a lot of waiting for one to free up. EV is good but not there yet for me.

Same here. Glad I didn’t jump on the Raven last summer. Hoping the devaluation of mine gets somewhat mitigated by the time Plaid comes out. But I’m mostly wondering now what this will mean for the Roadster: quad motor? full torque vectoring? Even faster 0-60?

If ~75 million shares are removed from the 142 million shares float, that leaves only 67 million shares, equivalent to a huge buyback program. I.e. only half of current Tesla investors will remain in the float: the most optimistic and long term ones.

bro Nikola Tesla was real

Maybe, but probably not as it does not go well for Uber - Tesla does not need more dram and if we are 1-2 years away why do it? Then it can go straight to fleet managers that are much better - so I think this is a good second option if FSD is not coming

I think its closer to ~15-20m share forced buying by passive funds indexed to S&P. Active funds benchmarked to S&P 500 would have to buy another 30-40m shares if they want to maintain Tesla exposure flat to their benchmark. But this part isn't forced buying & some own already.

22) For this reason there is an argument that even non EV components in Tesla cars could follow relatively steep learning curves in line with Tesla’s cumulative production (rather than tracking much smaller increases in cumulative historical car volume from the past 100 years).

21) This means the industry has not been learning enough from the hundreds of millions of cars it has produced over recent decades and there is a lot of slack for Tesla to apply new technology to reenergise innovation in components which are already extremely high volume.

18) Due to the tools Tesla uses to accelerate learning rates (higher R&D productivity, more agility to rapidly improve production processes, better engineering culture), Tesla can still achieve significant cost reductions in many of the car components common to both EVs and ICEs.

I can’t fully reject the fraud thesis. Almost no one saw Enron’s fraud. Are you saying @ Tesla doesn’t have $6B cash on hand? If there’s a fraud I could see that being it. Would only require a few people in the know to lie about it.

An estate has better headroom than either....

Remember big auto was the biggest investor in alternative fuel vehicles yet they are getting spanked by Tesla. I’ve been in big corporate too long to believe they will be a big player in alt energy. But hopefully the energy stocks have a little life left.

They might envisage it but their share prices might ensure a pivot before then. I don’t know if tesla is irrationally overvalued or GM/ford/Toyota and the rest are undervalued but it doesn’t bode well either way.

Interesting points you raise yet you left out maybe conveniently that not All of these versions will continue to see major updates to thier software and some probably not at all other than serious bug patches. Most older Tesla vehicles have cruise control and not Autopilot HW2

Multiple errors in the reasoning (to do with autonomy/AI not Tesla). I wont point them out because since @ wolfejosh blocks anyone who posts anything positive about @ Tesla there's no point enlightening him, let the share price do that.

Unfortunately using a battery to drive a motor can't be patented anywhere in the world. Even Tesla can't patent their EV. We used a couple of such bikes to deliver meals last year in industrial area.

Just passed a Tesla shop. Thought of @ DavidDobrik

Mt High is cool, but think I’ve only been there a couple times. We MOST often go Mammoth, even though it’s quite the trek. We’ve gone in the Tesla’s a boatload of times and the supercharger network up that way is perfect/easy and with one in mammoth itself is just...ideal.

So who won that Tesla from David Dobrik?

Also delivery times 6-8 weeks for U.S. Model 3 (March in Europe). Unless Tesla is shutting the line for an upgrade, this would indicate healthy demand.

I agree with you, unless it gets so bad it forces some sort of reckoning, like bleeding huge red ink from fines for non-performance, or a shutoff in revenues that exposes the accounting tricks, or new market stumble so bad that the core-market demand fall-off is obvious.

"He's a pacifist," Flynn points out. "He wouldn't endanger people with his inventions; you know that!" Rufus is unconvinced, casting a wary glance at Tesla staring down at the money. "You think he'll use that to fund Wardenclyffe?" "Maybe? It makes sense that he would."

Paul nailed it. There used to be two options, Autopilot ($3k) and Full Self Driving ($6k). Autopilot is now included and FSD has bumped up to $7k.

Creo q además, Tesla está desarrollando la tecnología de las baterías para usos de autoconsumo. Y como ingeniero eléctrico os aseguro q ese nicho va a ser muy superior a la automoción. Me resulta muy difícil de creer q alguna compañía nueva pueda hacerles competencia en un futuro

Yo si q he montado en Tesla y fue sorprendente y satisfactorio. Parece una nave espacial dedicada a mejorar la experiencia de conducción. Mi elección sin duda hubiera sido Tesla.

So you are absolutely right to be investing in Tesla for the benefit of your clients - but please remember that it should be viewed as a fundamental long-term growth investment - and not as some kind of “momentum trade” to jump in and out of as though it were a trading stock

We do it because of the biased media that always report on a Tesla fire and ignore ICE car fires. They give the impression that Teslas have a higher risk of catching fire but in fact, they have 1/8 the risk of an ICE car: https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport?redirect=no …

Is there enough proof now to argue that ICE driving Tesla haters are actively trying to cause Tesla crashes? How many drivers like this one might be caught by the Tesla camera evidence? Do the Police even try?

The stock market always prices in future returns. @ Tesla has to be analyzed as a tec company, since they are selling computers on wheels. They are disrupting a whole industry and legacy car makers can’t catch up. Even with high R&D spending, tesla is the first pick for engineers.

Yep I agree. But there are so many other ways to an accident

Well, not while justifying their current valuation they can’t. If FSD/Tesla Network does not materialize they need to produce much greater volume. Structurally they should be favored as a leader in BEV when we are just a few years away from BEV being cheaper than ICE.

Could one of you explain this point to a non-economist. I genuinely can't work out whether its an insight, snark or a sad commentary of the world today. My instinct say Tesla having leveraged a lot of research and investing heavily in R&D are the bet to make. Is this the point?

Most subsidies have finished for Tesla. And yet their sales have increased 50% and will again this year without any subsidies on units sold.

Earlier this month, Tesla crossed the $90 billion threshold. After the last few weeks, the company @ elonmusk founded in 2003 now boasts a market cap worth more than Ford, GM, and Fiat Chrysler combined. Just in case the rest of us might feel like we’re overachieving.

Dismissing media in general is dangerous - it opens up to a society where noone knows where to get information. And that is paradise for dictators. But media should be more responsible. I believe they report as best they can.

- have a boss like Elon Musk

I was in San Francisco for a meeting and saw a beautiful red S parked outside the place I had breakfast on the day I arrived. I had been following Tesla since the Roadster days and had seen the first delivery of the S so I knew exactly what it was. It looked even better in metal.

How and why is it that the next gen kids are so into @ Tesla and their mums & dads have zero idea? Maybe the reality that we have to wait another generation for EV’s to really put ICE cars on ice?

Tesla needs to sell units. They can't survive as a company selling 500k per year and being a subsidy hound. Their entire profit this last qtr were ZEV credits. No more credits if everyone has EV car. They need to sell rural.

Hola, en qué consiste? Los viajes largos en EV son siempre de los que mas se aprende. A veces a base de sufrir. Recordad que en Tesla, por debajo del 10% del SOC, la batería de 12v no es soportada y corre el riesgo de vaciarse, por lo que luego no es posible cargar el coche

Every time Elon Musk gets up to his cringey antics the Tesla share price shoots up, and the CEOs of all the other car companies are like “Ah, shit. Now I have to install GarageBand onto my Dell somehow so I can drop a terrible EDM track.”

Cost, complexity? Actually, I wonder know how much difference it makes? After the interior is warm I guess to keep the temperature hardly more than 2 kW is needed(?) If so only about 10 km range loss/hour. Also in really cold temperature heat pumps are not efficient anyway.

Flynn sees their faces. "It's not what you think! That's the money Edison owes you for fixing his engine. All of it--at least, I hope it's the full amount." Tesla continues to gape at him. "H-how..." "Let's just say that he and I had a heart-to-heart. I can be VERY persuasive."

Warning signs would exist if a company disregarded known practices (primer) and had mfring difficulties. Since what Tesla was attempting had no primer, errors were to be expected. Tesla iterated out those aspects that didn’t work, something normal when a process is new.

If you equate charging speed with price per kWh then this is the way forward. A subscription model may work in the medium term but as EVs become mainstream this is likely to go away, also Tesla may struggle to justify expansion against others in planning applications to councils.

3/ Tesla's main goals (so far) are to combat climate change and to encourage competition. Which means their number one goal isn't about making the most money (so far). Instead it's making cool gadgets that help the world and make humans feel safer. XID-3749

Most of them are now signaling that Tesla is right and lidar is a crutch and to solve self driving you need to solve vision. Vision can give you depth information the same way as we humans are able to do it with your two eyes.

This suggests that the Maxwell batteries are so good, that capacitors aren’t needed to make up for their shortcomings. In addition dry-cells have greater power density, are cheaper to make, faster to make, and have more lifetime duty cycles.

No, Elon didn’t say that “Maxwell was useless.” Maxwell sold ultra-capacitors, and were rumored to have a dry-cell battery formulation. Taken together, Musk’s statements suggest that the capacitors are unnecessary, and the batteries very important.

@ elonmusk When you said that the Chinese gov is way ahead in renewable energies and their car manuf. are begging for relief, would they be open to leasing the Tesla Skateboard tech to build the 8% they need next year? Is it on the table for them?

Tesla is releasing new models faster, opening factories faster (more cash available and cheaper cost) while at the same increasing efficiency and production capacity at existing factories. Definitely not linear.

....and cameras to learn about their surroundings. Tesla has few billions of miles of data to teach their software, while Waymo has tens of millions (only). Once Tesla has perfected it's autonomous tech, all its car can achieve l4 or maybe l5 autonomy with a flick of a switch.

Now Tesla can make one of their best financial moves and charge a royalty for other car makers to use these.

Disagree. A dealer network adds expenses recuperated from services, which are no longer required. Tesla had no option but to go for a direct model due to the low service requirements. ICE vehicles are subsidized and profits are made from spares over the 20y vehicle life

@ Tesla https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory …

It becomes very stark when you test drive a Tesla. “ holy crap, other car makers screwed” the only thing saving Oil right now is other EVs are sub par. If legacy automakers made a good EV like Tesla, oil would be sinking like the titanic. The writing is on the wall though.

It may change as electrification grows and the penalty for the SUV style is demonstrated. Tesla have hidden it on Model Y by making it look a bit odd & under calling range on the Model 3 on the EPA test.

Possible, but Model 3 will eventually get it as well. Form factor cannot be changed after conception

It's a comparison between 2 different classes of cars. One is a sedan and the second one is a pure full bloodied sports car. It would be more objective to compare/test cars in the same class i.e. 2 sports cars to get the picture (Roadster 2 against Taycan Turbo S).

Cause producing the batteries and mass electricity and waste will cause more pollution than gas.

Why not? Many shorts lost a lot of money listening to such talk. Many car makers falling way behind on autonomous driving and EVs heeding such advices. But @ Tesla is still fwaud as always because these people, though not experts, know for sure.

Zombies in the Walking Dead could have used self driving Tesla vehicles to cover large distances at a quicker pace... but I guess the show would not have been called The Walking dead any longer.

there’s a tesla at my work, and for months i interpreted its vanity plate as some kind endorsement of alcoholics anonymous before i realized it probably was referring to the battery: NEEDS2AA

While I don’t see any real competition right now (or in immediate future), I think it is risky for bulls (I’m one) to assume that nothing can eventually challenge Tesla. We should keep an open mind.

In the world of century old legacy auto makers, 10 year old is like a startup. I agree Tesla is steadily moving out of that startup phase. Rivian is a 10 yr old company too.

The intent was for that level from the start. Tesla simply attempted things that didn’t work but iterated thru it. This because there was no previous primer as with ICEVs. I’ve noted this a number of times. I’ll repeat. Nothing Tesla did was a ‘warning sign’.

I’m not a fan of hydrogen but clearly this guy doesn’t know how fuel cells work. It’s not by burning the fuel it’s by turning it into an electric current. You can replace the battery in a tesla with a fuel cell and use the same motors, the only difference is no regen.

This kid wasted about 20-minutes of my time. I think he just wanted to check out the Tesla. Which is a very nice way of saying, I don't think he likes Tesla's. It was borderline harassment.

you can’t make this shit up it’s like a Tesla supercharger ad @ elonmusk

What tesla is that in the background

He is talking that Tesla don't spend a penny in television, news paper and radio ads and despite that they are selling like hot cakes. The others car makers didn't advertised EVs, they didn't want it, just until know and despite that they are not selling. why? so so cars

Two different statements profitable on few quarters v/s loss on a whole year. Tesla is at loss on a whole year basis. But it’s less than what it was in 2018. And that’s what inspiring the investors. Since they are bringing in much more profitable product, the loss less or 0- 2020

Dan zou je moeten inzien dat subsidies geven aan zij die in de eerste plaats vermogend zijn om een nieuwe Tesla te kopen gewoon regelrchte diefstal is van zij die dat niet kunnen. Van zij die met een oa diesel moeten rijden en dan nog hoe langer hoe meer buitengesloten worden.

So an option K is like a “deposit contract” or a “right of first refusal” contract. In a call option (where you think the underlying stock price will go up), you have the right, but ZERO obligation, to buy the stock at a given price in the future. Can make $ that way.

you already know thats not true .. if it were .. tesla wouldnt need service centers or expand its services center to meet the need

Many thesis we could make, until Buffalo Can ramp up to meet the demand the PV cells might be made in China or Buffalo will be responsible in R&D and design center and mass production would be in China. Unless we hear from Tesla these are all pure speculations.

The star attribute is given to servants who changed and advanced humanity while weakening gods. Francis Drake has it because she sailed the world and more or less proved that such a thing is possible Tesla has it because as I mentioned, harnessed electricity

@ Tesla I heard Model 3 production stopped in Giga Shanghai by the Chinese government request.

Seeing them side by side at the last shareholders meeting, it looked as if the Y fixed a weak sight line the 3 has from the rear quarter, and in that respect looks a little better. I have a 3.

Oh com’on! The entire SEC investigation (which was years ago and has been dealt with) was because of a JOKE tweet, saying he would take Tesla private at 420...as in 420 the meme! I’m a stock holder, it didn’t scare me or anyone with an ounce of intelligence

In that case, Nikola Tesla would actually be a hard counter to any divine being who used lightning He has the star attribute after all, advancing humanity by harnassing electricity

I know but it's about affordability of car in indian market not everyone is capable to buy or afford the EV

some dude in a tesla just backed into my gfs hooptie

So, last year @ Tesla has to pay something like $900M in convertible debt because the stock price wasn’t high enough when the debt matured. Looking back, I think this was a good thing, because @ tesla still holds the equity, I think values in excess of $2B today

The CEO is laughing. He isn't scared. My guess is, he knows the truth behind Tesla, and just can't say it, but laughs at the bulls

He should call his Tesla "spit cat" more than smooth cat

Your example is exactly what I’m talking about. Automating these lines had never been done before. Some things worked, some didn’t. None of it was a warning sign as there was no previous primer like for ICEVs. Tesla was simply first. All other mfrs will encounter similar issues.

@ elonmusk Loved the new EDM song Elon! Love the simple concept of the Tesla, easy; yet, perfect! Space X is pretty cool. I wonder what can be done for homes? We need better appliances, heating & cooling, solar, water heating, lighting systems, insulation, Windows, doors! Ur it!

Previous rt. I measured 100 micro tesla under that sort of power line. It was a food joint.

Pshhhh just another snack for the Tesla. Wake up to new software updates for more horsepower, full tank every morning at a 1/5 the cost of gas, road trips wherever.

I hate the environment. I love global warming Have you ever done anything in your life as great as the the founders of VW and Audi and Ford? Why do you hate them?

When you look at companies under Elon's development, each could be a piece of an off planet base. Tesla motors - EV transportation/construction vehicles Boring Co - mining/habitats Tesla power - solar power/storage Space X - transportation/resource gathering. Whats next Elon?

Evan is an electric van that was one of around 200 to 500 made in the early 1990s. He began life with an approximate price tag of $100kUSD. I reckon that makes him a 1990s Tesla! His motor faces the rear of the van and goes into a reduction drive. pic.twitter.com/s2fvQmCl6w

Looks like you’re the only one on your Fursla touchscreen so you can still order a Model S P85D vs Dodge Challenger Hellcat in a candy store, design your dream Tesla.

The argument as to ‘warning sign’ is misguided. Tesla simply encountered issues because it was first and there was no primer. It iterated out of those issues but having them in the first place was to be expected.

I recently drove a Tesla... scratch that... I was recently driven by a Tesla. It was phenomenal. There’s nothing like being witness to the future.

I have a 5.3 kw system being installed this Wed 05/02. Most likely a Tesla Powerwall the year after (if not sooner, depending on finances).

Better, cheaper, more available? Tesla and SolarCity have always installed 3rd party panels.

@ elonmusk current car design patterns of hood and trunk are due to ice engine requirements which is not the case for Tesla. The whole car deign can be rethought including the wheels size, position and quantum. Cars can way more than 4 wheels hood trunk and cabin.

It isn’t one solution, but multiple ... work, retail, mall, mass transit lots, municipal parking lots, school, dedicated urban charging centers, on-street charging, and getting apartment owners to install charging stations

1. there IS a back facing camera in the TESLA Model 3, not yet in use 2. until TESLAs are not approved for level 4 FSD, it would be too dangerous having all parents looking into the screen all the time while driving 3. your ideas are great but sometimes a matter is more complex

Which is why Tesla is obviously here for the long term.

I didn't find the the extended warranty accounting in Tesla's K's. For both F and GM there are separate accounts. That's the problem with Tesla reporting, it's so fucking opaque it's hard to know what they're doing ia lot of accounts.

Incorrect. No one had ever mass produced BEVs at this scale before. Tesla was learning as it went as there was no primer. Look at what just happened with the ID.3 to see how even a mature mfr can still have issues with new tech.

Wrong again, there is no current federal investigation into Tesla and there certainly isn’t any into SpaceX. It is hearsay,How do you know what happened?She’s clearly a manipulator, theres so many unknowns, did she tell Elon she was abused!? If so there’s no moral issues

I haven't had pizza for a while. Maybe when my own BD arrives in July. Haven't followed Tesla, except for a writer who's Home Owner's Association that they'd see her fry in hell -- free translation -- before OKing a charging station for her. That seems extreme!

@ elonmusk you should really see who is running your customer service/sales. Extremely poor customer experience from start till now. Zero response from online orders despite 5 emails over 2 weeks. No escalation path. Very disappointed as a new Tesla owner.

lol she's literally taking a break because Tesla is having a positive news cycle. Negative news isn't sticking. She will return when her negative gossip gets more clicks. And she's certainly not the "worst." She seems like she wishes she could be more unbiased. But clicks...

@ fredsa you in or are you out ?

No, I haven't been back lately. Work has been too hectic. It is an irrelevant exercise. If Tesla has demand in other areas they will just move the cars. Registrations in CA are down dramatically so there is no reason to check inventory. Sales are diminishing.

Tesla put that revenue on a separate bank account and don't count it till the customer actually take delivery.

A couple other things to think about. A lot of Tesla owners (model s and X ) but the extended warranty(I didn’t). What pile does that go into? I am at 75k and have had no maintenance. I am halfway to that being a good decision. I think it was $4k or $5k for 50k more miles.

Can u also fix the bug where the cars glitch out especially Tesla's plz

Wrong again, there is no current federal investigation into Tesla and there certainly isn’t any into SpaceX. It is hearsay,How do you know what happened?She’s clearly a manipulator, theres so many unknowns, did she tell Elon she was abused!? If so there’s no moral issues

Lost it all back? When did that happen ?you mean the whole run down after Q1 results. Lol. U know why it went down because investors thought the slump was because of the loss of subsidy & investors were nervous so that made the dip. In reality Tesla made more in 2019.

. @ elonmusk why don’t the Tesla’s have seat presets for the passenger seats? Thanks!

No. It's more complicated than that. The total reserve as opposed to the marginal change includes provisions for recalls and other adjustments. Tesla is under reserving. On a claims basis he's likely right. $ has a much lower incident of claims.

Just for good measure, before you reformat, re-partition the drive too (fat32), & then format the new partition. add your Teslacam folder, & you should be good2go. Be sure to copy off any data that you need, because repartitioning, and formatting will destroy any existing data.

I look at it as the model y has better maintenance since 100m of wiring is a reduction of 10 fold compared to the 3. Also better design, expandability if you are thinking of a family. I'm getting the Ct for those reasons but I work a lot.

2016: the year that people found out that Tesla teleportation had been achieved 50 years ago by DARPA and classified ever since ..

Similarly, I’m sure that the CCP offering preferential treatment to Tesla, Tesla moving engineering design to China and Musk always having used blurry boundaries between Tesla & SpaceX poses no national security concern at all.

Bingo! If only his relatives had taken a ride in Tesla in the beginning then probably he would have let us in on the stock when it went IPO at $17 a share. But water is under the bridge

Exxxxactly. I was wondering the same thing. Good eye. I don’t think anyone else caught that.

How’s your Tesla like to drive ?

It's a know fact that charging the battery to 100% is horrible for longevity. Tesla allows it while other manufacturers lock it. Musk's own recommendation is staying between 20-80 while their battery expert recommended 30-70. Unlocking it gives a false marketing advantage.

I got my T5 500GB from Best Buy. Never had issues. I’ll reformat it once I get home and report back on status.

In my understanding people who want a Tesla at this point hv much better options. So a suv guy doesn’t need to buy M3, as u can get MY in few mos. But internationally, M3 would do the same as before or better & I expect it to be priced bit more cheaper too. Just my speculations.

Tesla stocks jumped last night despite a vaguely disappointing set of financials for Q4 of the company's fiscal 2019.

I think a lot of tesla schematics besides their battery is open source, we might soon see the same in spaceX

why? investors are not expecting dividend payments from Tesla, and they can tolerate the high cost of R&D. Investors want to make profit from the value they create through innovation and growth potential

I am not an expert in autonomous driving so I can only go by the what more knowledgeable people have inferred. Tesla is not the leader in Auto. Driving. In addition, their R&D spend is infinitesimal compared to leaders like Waymo. Common sense says they will fall further behind.

That doesn’t change that Tesla might only sell 3 out of 100 new cars in 2025 - as stated - that is an amazing feat ... but it still leaves 97% for the other OEMs

Not sure where you are getting your numbers from. Tesla actually sold more in US in 2019 compared to 2018. Their S/X sales dropped but M3 more than compensated for it in 2019. All the while they sold more M3s internationally. pic.twitter.com/mhE0jMfM5G

Have you ever thought about making an engineer school? This will help solve the shortage People today think "more money" helps and I always said that Tesla cannot grow faster with more money they need more people as they are maybe 100s there only Im so glad you confirmed it

Watched! You’re probably right, or maybe there is a software nerf in there to prevent the batteries from failing as soon? The X and S have a different cell than the 3 right? The closest thing I can anecdotally say I’ve experienced is a quicker taper off but I just got 120 today.

Maybe you should back off on the advice to your clients until you take a deep dive into Tesla’s technology development path. It’s the real deal. I recommend you start by watching this presentation by the head of # Tesla’s FSD team: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE&feature=share …

Including used car sales is just spin. Used cars does not put money in manufacturers pockets. Tesla has only been producing 100k+ cars per year for 3 years. And people tend to keep their Teslas.

Mad 4x4 pulling a bus from down farm fields.

What happens in the world affects what happens here. US is an EV laggard. But the longer we delay, the bigger the ramp will be later. 3% is about 500k new cars. Tesla can sell that in the US in 2021. If market drops to 14M by 2022 they could sell 6%.

Apparently they did make profits for past 2 Qtr. So I agree they haven’t made yrs of profit but that’s what is getting changed. Any new disrupters weren’t making profits right away & it took a while. also, technically Tesla sold more cars in US with lesser subsidy in 2019.

Buying what much ? Am sorry my friend it’s a miracle that Tesla was able to sell these many M3 on a segment where others are retracting. End of Q1, MY is out which is to a bigger market. And most of US sales are on suv space. So just one word, brace yourself.

What you fail to realize as a Tesla hater is that Tesla has done enough to cause consumer behavior to change. Soon Tesla might sell 20 out of 500 cars. ICEV sales will implode and Tesla has 80% of BEV market. Won't stay that way, but they aim for 20%.

Your risk taking ability comes with experience. If Tesla has to build a gas car, it will be having worst efficiency than any OEMs, ‘cause OEMs have experience and road experience to know how far they can push it. Now legacy have no clue how batteries or softwares would behave.

The costs of electrons are set by your power co. You plug in your car to any wall outlet - Either 120V or 240V I pay 10 cents per kWh. Gas pumps don't work in a power outage and Tesla will truck in battery packs to power charger (already do this for holiday travel)

They want it or not, Unlike other OEMs, Tesla will have volunteers lining up to help them at many things. Even making fan based advertisements or doing meetups. Not sure how/why tons of consumers liking a company a product a lot gonna hurt them. I know it will hurt your position.

Have to admit, it’s been a great week. :) Thought $600 would happen last week but was sad about stagnation between 530-570 shortly after the $597 peak. Then < 1 week passed $ TSLA Can’t wait for Model Y production & Tesla Semi, because 650 will seem shrimpy by then. pic.twitter.com/irBlk2gUFg

You go gurl! Celebrate!

I know you get riled with these statements. Every company has departments handling these issues. The thing confuses me is that, you do want Tesla to be perfect & have more concerns than majority of Tesla owners but r betting against the same company. It’s a tough place to be :).

Well, I do believe we, as Tesla fans, forget how easy “getting gas” was/is because of our love of the cars. We tend to make excuses for sitting at Superchargers for long periods of time and act like it’s not a big deal. For most it is.

Not true. They don’t seek it. They believe that Musk will eventually run the company into the ground and frankly this isn’t without basis as he is both Tesla’s greatest strength and it’s greatest weakness. They are generally pro EV (or at least not anti EV) too.

I still remember those debates where they vehemently argued Tesla will file for chapter 7 bankruptcy. They were hell bent to prove there won’t even be restructuring at Tesla. They will be torn apart and sold for parts. Their hatred of Tesla knows no bounds.

He charged mostly at home using supercharging only for long distance trips and given how few miles he's driven in total it's obvious his battery has not been supercharged that much. Tesla should not advertise the ridiculous range the way they do if you're not allowed to use it.

We already know the Taycan's real range in good conditions is likely about 280 miles, when they unlock the battery it will be 310 miles. We need both the EPA range testing system completely changed and a new battery warranty standard to debunk Tesla's advantage.

Wow, that is so true. I hadn’t considered the fact that there are many young millennials invested in tesla, with a hope that “someday” they could afford one. The stock surging will certainly lead to more sales by helping them reach that point sooner.

$ TSLA it’s not apples to apples when comparing Tesla against any ICE manufacturers because Tesla doesn’t have massive cash sucking middle man dealerships, additionally precision engineering relieves future overhead such as parts replacement/recalls.

@ elonmusk How is it possible that the # wipers automatic mode in my # Tesla # Model3 is horribly worse than in a 2005 @ VW # Jetta I had 15 years ago? - Dump # AI # BS, program it reasonably good - Make them speed sensitive Or # ask @ vw how to do it. But make it usable!!!

Thank you @ LeilaniMunter ! @ emilyshorin numbers don’t make sense. “Women make 80% of car buying decisions”. That means 100% of married women made the purchasing decision to offset for any single men. IIHS - “Many more men than women die each year in motor vehicle crashes.”

I just kno nebula got that tesla pussy

To be fair, Tesla is doing way more than keep the lights on considering it’s a very young auto manufacturing company along with energy, software and solar to it. Ur reference falls back to 2018, I suppose. Now legacy OEMs are asking for subsidies to survive this EV shift.

Not sure, I think Tesla did do a bunch of Solar + Powerwall installations for schools, hospitals etc in Puerto Rico

Neither. They are both dick waving irrelevances in today’s car world. More interested to see stuff on Honda E, or new batttery tech that charges quicker, lasts better, and stores more energy. Speed is dangerously irrelevant on today’s roads. Time to grow up.

Trash ass foo you got the Tesla that shit can drive for you no ?

I am - I believe in Tesla/free energy, We, the people (Q) and that we are made from stardust and that some of us here are reincarnating, waking up and becoming the truth of who we really are and in many cases understanding what purpose we serve during this great awakening.

$136,000. I did the math today. This is how much money I have lost in the last year and a half of shorting Tesla by using deep OTM puts and other stupid levers. I am lucky that this is not a major part of my wealth, but this still took time to accumulate. I'm out of the trade.

You’re a smart guy, if Tesla had to raise $10 bn they would have no probs doing so. If Tesla believed they needed $5 bn to keep up with the “big boys”, they would have raised it. E says theyre spending as fast as they can. Leads me to believe you’re missing part of the equation.

point 5/100: Tesla's market share of addressable markets will expand rapidly to 50% +. Consumers will stop buying "typewriters" as they realize Tesla "robots" are simply out of this world better deal vs ICE or alt-EV. Perhaps someday Tesla MS will decline. 15+20% way too low.

Yes, we will know if QE played a big part if we see a bunch of Institutional holders owning Tesla when they submit their 13-F holdings. If not, this run up was caused by a tight float and the run down can be as quick as the run up.

It does not matter. But plaid is better. Range and entertainment rock! And the plaid understeer issue which someone mentioned earlier, if real, must be just growing pains because it should be easily controlled by varying the torque of each of the rear motors.

Then why is Tesla making it out to be so difficult, especially after you and Elon keep saying it's so straight forward?

OK, I llwas mistaken I checked a Ford dealershio and Toyota, got offers from $9k-$11k, I traded it directly to Tesla who found a buyer in Iowa for $16k. Still, it depreciated $10k in 3 years
