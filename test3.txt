@ Shannon_Liao The person who hit the Cybertruck in the reveal is Franz von Holzhausen, Chief of Design at Tesla. You should update your article so that it identifies him. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Holzhausen …

Tesla received 146,000 Cybertruck pre-orders in a day (vs Model 3’s 180,000 in the first 24h - though the deposit is $100 vs M3’s $1,000). Doesn’t look too bad?

Good, but I’ve had issues with their chargers. I think it needs to be owned and operated by the car mfg like Tesla rather than 3rd party.

After the climate change cons trick the world into a carbon neutral economy, the Tesla truck will be the go to truck to attack neighbors for their livers and huge drumsticks.

why is my dad buying the new @ Tesla truck

It would, but it would take too much time. I’d say the EV uptake in Norway is an example of something that works; with govt incentives they turned Tesla model S into the most reasonable car for businesses and contractors to buy. Now half of new cars sold are electric.

My wife specifically said she was not gonna ride in a Cybertruck So I hope Tesla is not doing the edgier design on all models.

Please tell us if you ordered a Cybertruck @ Jack.

I really like it. It was better than I expected and the performance of it really impressed me. It's really like a super advanced machine from the future!

I don’t really know how to feel about the new Tesla trucks being released..

I still can't find the answer - what is the reason for the triangular body shape ? Purely aesthetic or actual physics behind it ? If large loads were transported on the roof, it would make a lot of sense. Otherwise - what is the purpose for this body shape, anyone knows ?

those pointy edges at the rear you just need to stumble on while the car is parked and you kill yourself. love that design but im p sure it wont be allowed on roads with that at least in germany. thats still an easier fix than a crumple zone for sn exo skeleton i reckon.

Good thing you added that red arrow bc otherwise I wouldn't have known where to look

A car can be groundbreaking, fun to drive, and have limited issues which still allow the owner to experience things like having to drive 4 hours for service, not telling customer what was fixed (or not) until days after pickup in a pdf that expires, not calling or allowing calls

The problem with the # TeslaPickupTruck is that it’s too expensive. Most people cant afford it. Which means it’s inaccessible, and environmental options that are inaccessible will never make a difference to the environment. Tesla vehicles are about status, not the environment.

You say it does fit with Tesla’s mission for mass adoption of EVs. But reading the Motor Trend article, the design makes sense from a manufacturing perspective. i.e. great specs, easy to produce at the lowest price than competitors. Making it within reach to MANY people.

We can argue about Tesla’s valuation or future. But saying they aren’t innovative in their vehicles and disregarding their role in accelerating the transition to EVs? Maybe a bitt too much.

Also space and utility

Another nail in Tesla's coffin - legacy automakers sell around 13 million pickups a year and if Tesla thinks this thing is going to take a bite out of that, @ elonmusk is an even bigger idiot than I already think he is. Tesla needs mass market to survive and this aint it.

Hello Tesla

Very simple... jut put your FSD Model 3 to do Ride Share, and they will pay for the Cybertruck

Why my pops just reserve one of them tesla trucks

Yep, it's a busy now either way. But the hype is alive at least, I'm pretty sure they'll fix it a bit before launch.

I think the Cybertruck has real potential. Needs a lot more design finetuning - It literally just looks unfinished to me. Otherwise it'll be too niche to be feasible. Tesla can deliver with performance, what they have to win on is the mass appeal of the aesthetic. They didn't. https://twitter.com/JaredoTexas/status/1198385013399707648 …

You only got 50% of that right. The car is equally a POS.

Factoids meaning statements completely irreverent from the conversation. I'm talking about one thing, but you're so blinded by your hate for Tesla, your bringing up random factoids. I have no team here besides logic, but clearly you do.

Will u show off the cyber truck

(regardless, im eager to see the results. Tesla has consistently had some pretty amazing crash test ratings, particularly the model 3. So they do have /some/ idea as to what theyre doing in this regard. Will be interesting to see what kind of revisions get made)

Any non-Tesla charger now requires dipping a credit card vs plug and go, often stops mid-charge, is always slow, usually only 1 or 2 chargers at any station, and is spread thin. Tesla is the only good road trip experience as yet.

I know, the man is brilliant. I somehow think there are big shareholders that want Tesla to fail, to slow down his grip on global car sales. The traditional oily car manufacturers are weary of this progress.

Wow. Simply said: Constructive criticism, or even opinionated reporting of Donald Trump is not "negative reactions" far from it. Devin Nunes wanting to share his naked pictures of Trump, now that most certainly would have a negative reaction.

Every other mainstream car manufacturer is watching Tesla with interest...because they all believe that they will fail in the long run. The car industry is cyclical, and sooner or later another (better) electric car will come along and Model 3 sales will fall through the floor.

THAT is a brilliant idea but I'm afraid your children may not fall for that. BUT it is the very first pick up that you created so for them it could be the OFFICIAL very first pick up. You're precious DADDY

I can’t wait to road trip in a Tesla truck

Alright, i think ima trade in the lexus for the tesla cyber truck.

No more renting a truck to move items. It has a self installed ramp for easy loading. Functional and private. Cover protect the contents inside if it rains. It is a huge improvement and functional. # Kudos 2 E and the # TeslaTeam Tesla received 146,000 orders for the # Cybertruck xohttps://twitter.com/Sofiaan/status/1198373433320464384 …

It’s a new business model: forget about selling to the mass market. Just let the influencers buy everything. There’s probably enough of them.

Having just recently watched Mars series on Netflix, Musk's unbreakable Tesla glass broken by a lad with a stone definitely puts things in perspective.

But as you said earlier Tesla are reinvesting that money in expansion. So it's probably going to be another 10 years before they get anywhere near repaying their investors. That's a big gamble. All it takes is another massive recession and Tesla are screwed.

It won't have mirrors, just like the Roadster. And Tesla put a new patent for a new kind of wipers, not the kind that clean only ¾ of the windshield

Tesla already received 146,000 orders for the new cybertruck and damn that was fast

I bet 100% of likes on this post don't own a Tesla.

Yeah we wanted that too, but we ran out of time!

That's the best

I will

Put our order in. Not a truck dude but we are a Tesla family. I see this more as a people mover with incredible flexibility for the several times a year I need to haul stuff.

Main stream media headlines are usually biased about Tesla. Whatever generates the most ad clicks for them.

I do agree there. Torn between the necessity of converting trucks to EV while still realizing no one needs this kind of vehicle, gas or electric

@ Tesla couldn't come up with an uglier car eh

I could use the new Tesla truck, thanks.

Agree, but as you stated, the reservations won’t turn into buyers, so the ones that do pull the trigger will be getting the discount. Tesla will continue to increase FSD for future reservationists

I love this car

Yes. Put an 86 Tesla Magnetic Field @Mars L1 using a giant superconducting coil powered by a mini fusion reaction (& solar array?) with battery storage capacity to regulate it. It's going to happen. Whoever does it, will be forever remembered. @ NASA has the reactor design.

Let’s do this, how about you go ride in the front seat with someone in a normal car who falls asleep, and I’ll ride in the front seat of of my Tesla and fall asleep. Then we can see which car is superior. Let me know I’ll meet you wherever.

Gavrill, come on man... this is not stunning your designs are a trillion times better than this!

You literally support the use of fossil fuels everyday through use of electricity and cars. Do you have a Tesla? Didn’t think so, so stop crying about using fossil fuels, hypocrite

Time will tell. They already have almost 150,000 pre-orders. By the way Tesla absolutely dominates the EV marketplace, so don’t assume this won’t sell.

He’ll make that up by Monday when the market opens up. He’s made $3 billion in sales in 48hrs for a truck that downs Thor market until 2021! Also 7% intraday is a typical day for Tesla stock. It’s a bumpy ride, but he always finds a way

Combustion engines burn 40 times more often than electric cars calculated per million kilometers and are other manufacturers obliged to dispose of your vehicles??? For disposal Intakter cells Tesla has several dealers

$100 for a reservation... fully refundable.. I just spent that in McDonalds for dinner. I’m convinced Elon Musk is sitting in a Willard White penthouse lair stroking a white cat and pissing himself laughing watching the world fawn in awe!

Why r celebs flexing that they ordered the new Tesla it’s literally $150 to pre order and I bet non of them will driving it when it comes out

then he would've fucked up majorly and have to pay back all 146k+ people that pre-ordered

I am pretty sure they have a solution, Tesla Cars are literally the savest cars in production right now by a far margin. Also this car is just a prototype right now, it will probably go through alot of iteration until production in some years like all things from Tesla/SpaceX.

ALL of Tesla’s other vehicles are relatively small with a low hood. If there was such a law, it’d be to Tesla’s advantage.

It is not a slogan. One who has negative reactions to President Donald Trump that are irrational and have little regard towards Trump's actual positions or actions taken. You are welcome

True

The Tesla truck doesn’t even have windshield wipers. So when it rains, you...like... can’t drive

Looks aside, the truck is an absolute beast performance wise. As a truck guy myself, I can respect the amount of power this thing has. Pretty cheap for what it is too if the prices I've seen are real.

I get the Tesla Cybertruck or na?

They are all 100% true except I need a new Tesla Cybertruck, right now. But otherwise

Dont forget the broken piggy bank in the design, or do whatever you want, just a suggestion.

Sure I would drive one! No way I would call it a truck though... No matter how much steroids you feed a car, it's still a car.

Funny thing is 99% of Tesla “problems” early on were paint and panel gaps....don’t think many of this truck will have that as a possibility!

@ elonmusk my friend Bruce, who just ordered six of your new trucks, told me that the plural of @ Tesla is Tesli. I like it. That’s all.

Who said innovative? It's different than what's on the road. Tesla never called it "innovative" sounds like you're hating to hate

That’s what everyone is saying!!! And it’s starting to on me as well

That Tesla truck is nice idk what y’all talking about

But without a trailer, it's not too wide or long?

I see lots mentioning how the Tesla truck windows broke... But they're not mentioning the dude took a sledgehammer to the door and nothing happened! Whether you like the design or not, that'd badass.

Deposits for Tesla Cybertruck hit $14.6 million https://tcrn.ch/2DclELy via @ techcrunch

Look at that median age. Do you think people of the demographic really dig the cyberpunk design of the Tesla truck? It's polarizing to even the millennials. I don't think he will convert many people to his new truck. Probably first time buyers will make up bulk of thr demand.

Still $100 with FSD

Why aren't you crusading against all of the other cars that don't have the safety features that Tesla's do? Fall asleep in a Tesla and you and everyone else will likely be safe. Do that in any other car and you're likely to kill somebody. This is the wrong crusade!

Love it! Stealing it!!!

If it's got gooseneck add-on capability for towing, my wife and I are in! The two year buffer is just a plus financially.

Me neither but if you figure out how to get that TESLA bread lmk keem

This is a truck not a car and a different market from all the techies for decided to out up a refundable $100. It's the buys who are construction sites in the city, repair men, out in Texas. Those are truck customers and not the people on Twitter raving or hating on it.

I think you are wrong here. Tesla might pay them in comps like the events etc. And give them better treatment. But they make the money from posting it to youtube and monetizing the views. The ad-revenue is high on tesla content. I think boogie misspoke and meant this ad-revenue.

Tesla truck........... based?

It looks like origami but with aluminum foil instead of paper.

That’s it. Can it be done with this.

Given the choice between a NEW small hatchback and a used Model S, with similar range and similar performance (mines a bit faster), I think you can guess which I'd prefer ;). Bear in mind, I was not a Tesla fan when I bought it. Driving it made me the fan I am today ;)

Large dangerous vehicle usage is a real problem that needs solving, but Tesla will not be the one to solve that problem. Support people tackling it directly

Fools fail to see how many people have died by vehicles under human control vs people killed by vehicles under robotic control. Humans are waaaaaay worse drivers.

Which Tesla.. I haven't seen the Tesla's lap record yet. If anything this needs to beat it's cars like the Senna and GT2 RS MR.

Ok. Saturday night. Might email noam chomsky . Prob just subject others around me to rants about that new tesla truck disaster

It’s horrendous!! And the shatterproof glass that shattered immediately when something was lightly thrown at it was hilarious

Welcome to the Take Two Club, @ Tesla!

I agree with you, and I would be cool with laws saying you need a business reason and a higher class license to drive such a vehicle (as well as additional tax), but it’s not the legal system we live in now. And that’s not Tesla’s fault.

“Disjointed from reality “, says the trump sycophant trying to create their own reality where ‘windmills cause cancer” and “Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election”

I’m guessing they retrofit pull-through chargers for Cybertrucks pulling trailers

Give it a couple years and just like the other Tesla the price will drop. But still even normal trucks are like $50-60k so it might not drop much.

Ever since @ Tesla/ @ elonmusk debuted the Cyber Truck I have got non-stop truck ads from @ Ford, @ Dodge

Tesla is desperately trying to redefine truck. No matter how ugly you make a car, it's still a car. Here is an e-pickup: https://bollingermotors.com/bollinger-b2/

You probably were allegedly driving and let your wife take the blame cause you were drinking. Boating for 40 yrs and something is fishy!! Mr. Wonderful. If you like Trump then sounds about right.

Autonomy is not a binary thing (well, it is, but let's put the pun aside); Tesla's Autopilot is not fully self-driving, but it is considerably safer than normal driving while monitored at all times. There are ways to improve safety easily, e.g. auto emergency braking

My @ Reuters report on @ Tesla securing 146,000 orders for its # Cybertruck unveiled on Thursday. @ elonmusk's tweet on the orders comes as the much-anticipated $ TSLA Cybertruck launch suffered a setback over design & the shattering of "armored glass" windows. http://reut.rs/2L3f7Hx https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1198354652745682945 …

Yes, but here’s a counter-argument: a buyer can lock in the currently low price of FSD for three years! Does that make economic sense from Tesla’s perspective? Not really...

JAJAJAJA ALV

He also didn't found @ Tesla He invested. Got a board seat. Secured other investments, with an add a board seat contingency until he gained control. Then fired the founder. And it's findable if you want. I'm not doing your research for you.



martin eberhard, the actual founder who invented the power train approach used by Tesla, and was forced out and stripped of his founder title by Musk in a punitive hostile action

And I can't argue with you there. Some Tesla fans can be a bit much at times (myself included).

Esa es space X. Tesla pierde plata hace 10 años.

EVs were looked down on because the legacy autos released shitty compliance EVs that didn’t work for regular drivers. Check the sales numbers on Tesla and you’ll find it’s a very different story when the EV is made to be better than an ICV every respect.

Obviously the answer David alleges Tesla IR gave is nonsense. Customers in Europe paying by personal check? Nonsense. (Note: bank checks count as cash not A/R.) “Last day of the quarter is on a Sunday” is similarly nonsense, and yes we heard that, but we believe the above.

Shame on you earl.

Tesla is actually pretty smart using straight lines and flat panels. Makes it a lot easier to manufacture. Also stainless steel and no paint. Eliminates the need for a paintshop. This thing will be as easy as lego to assemble.

It matters much less than you think for long term stock holders.

though possibly speaking they could just have wanted to test the rovers so why not let truckers try rocks, mud, sand and give feedback

Whoa! By comparison, Ford sold 1.1 million Ford F150s last year. The Tesla was unveiled less than 48 hours ago. http://bit.ly/2Of57wQ

So? Tesla exists because of subsidies granted by the US. But... every other American car manufacturer exists because of subsidies and bailouts. I don't hate the player, I hate the game.

Never thought I'd pick a non-tesla over a Tesla but yeah, the rivian looks way better.

Especially since he literally did force out the founder of Tesla motors, Martin Eberhard, who came up with the battery and power train. Musk literally had himself retroactively named founder (because he was the first series A investor!) and had the title stripped from martin

that 2nd one looks boring as hell tbh

Also, do not forget, this is the same company that sued Tesla alleging that Tesla copied their semi truck design.

Well... one thing we can see from other EV makers is that they are not as efficient as Teslas. The form factor must have a lot to do with it. A typical truck isn't particularly aero, so they will be at a disadvantage. I expect a radical change in truck designs going forward.

I thought it was SpaceX's first land rover for Mars. Also, are you producing a radar proof/black model?

Yeah I think the design is cool but people are missing the point. It Is a pickup truck. Its best model can haul a Lot and get 500 miles out of it. The truck is very spacious and the self-drive features will be great too. And you are right, it may be easy to reproduce the body.

Perfect if you want coffee on the go

Which is interesting considering that it seems to be styled for low manufacturing cost. Joined flat panels allows Tesla to use cold rolled steel plates, which is both cheaper to manufacture, and allows them to make the truck lighter, which improves perf & reduces materials cost

Tell your kids that’s the first pick up truck ever drawn and you found the drawings on a cave wall

this thing will likely be a much more normal sight than you want it to be

Cybertruck is better in every way. And you cannot beat those specs & price points! Smokes everyone else, even Hummer # Tesla

That truck is uglier. I didn’t think it would be possible.

Recall every car and make them so that they shouldn’t start if the seat belt is not on!

It would not be advertising. As stated, it would be *PSA-style*, which would also be a significant tax-deduction and goodwill business effort. Regarding sales, you’re forgetting the new & upcoming gigafactories- plus production has improved (quality) and increased (efficiency).

But the root of it is, Musk isn't Tesla (the company, obviously he's not the person). He's the man doing the marketing. The public face. But Tesla was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.

Elon, hope you come back when you complete the GiGAfactory...You know you are a white American...I am sorry say that but I come from there...How long could be the honeymoon for Tesla in China? 3years? 5 years?

It will be the best truck you can buy and the best value. The look is simple to keep costs down but the features are off the chain. Tesla is the only reason any other company even makes an electric car today. And still Tesla dominates every category they're in.

It certainly looks intimidating! So, hummer versus cyber truck. Which would be more intimidating? Hummer is physically larger, but the cyber truck looks more intimidating to me. In a good way!

So Kev has your wife's new boating safety school opened yet?

You can always count on the cultists to point to non-GAAP and "adjusted EBITDA" metrics when a company can't make or fake a profit. The same people who ignore the fact that Tesla's "profits" don't actually come from selling cars. Kinda seems like a big problem for a car company.

Musk entiende cómo funciona el marketing en 2019. No han hecho NI UN SOLO comercial pagado para promocionar la pick-up Tesla y ya tienen 146000 órdenes a menos de una semana del anuncio oficial (transmitido por redes sociales).

What do Motorola, Tesla and Apple have in common: they rebuilt Retro designs and mixed it with new, controversial and nostalgic things, creating a new branch of aesthetic design very similar to vaporwave art, we'll call that # VaporDes (Vaporwave+Design).

It's definitely a healthy number, but the truck, as presented, wouldn't be road legal, it'll have to change quite a bit before release - and most concepts have a tendency to get a lot less striking when that happens.

Cyber truck launch was a total disaster ! With the specs and price it really doesn’t matter what it looks like as every commercial pickup anywhere now has to be a Tesla ! Low cost of maintenance and fuelling a business would be stupid to buy anything but a Tesla ! Yes a disaster!

Yeah but the Cybertruck has a new dynamic to it. It's pretty much a no compromise car. Economical (it's an EV) Tons of storage Suitable for all conditions Seats 6 Similarly priced to a Model 3/Y The only compromise may be on 'luxury', and ease of parking in tight city streets.

no one said it was any of those things? Like, it's a police report showing that someone at Tesla fabricated a story to implicate a whistle blower in a potential shooting. That's literally a fact. How the fuck is that fake news?

Ha. I almost never use my brake pedal so this did sound almost plausible. BMW do stop the car completely under regen but they don’t have quite such a smooth pull away as a tesla when the electronic handbrake is auto-disengaged as you press the throttle.

Must be nice

I too want a Tesla, but I’m going to get the Model 3 because I just want a car. I have no plans on looking like I’m just back from the space station.

But imagine thinking this clown is a reliable source is fucking bonkers

The Tesla truck is not a truck, period.

I personally know someone who worked for Tesla for over a year and I can tell you their cars are poorly manufactured, overpriced, ramshackle pieces of shit

"Trump Derangement Syndrome", is that slogan still a thing. Anyways, this so-called Trump Derangement Syndrome isn't my problem, as syndrome is named after Trump - e.g. Lou Gehrig's disease.

And Alex seemed to have a much bigger issue with Fred's writing about Tesla than Elon and Tesla directly. He has criticisms sure, but doesn't appear to have any interest in the financial or business details. Just if he likes the products they eventually deliver.

Plz don’t change it

The suggestion s that bulls are lending free money to Tesla for some reason. He doesn't think people will buy it. He thinks people just want to give money to Tesla for nothing, as opposed to for something. Which I view as kind-of bullish actually

The internet has you all fooled that the Tesla truck isn’t one of the ugliest vehicles ever created

Thought the bottom looked pretty cool when I first saw it, but the actual design is way better

I'm a huge Tesla bull. But this thing is DOA.

Can’t tell if the new Tesla truck is a step into the past or into the future with the styling

Super cool view. It's a beautiful colored piece of art.

I think it doesn't look too bad.



Bro it doesn't look cool and is not looking so cyber!!! But it's like Brand addict guy's as soon as the latest is announced they just want to have it. I love and appreciate what your doing for @ Tesla and specally @ SpaceX but this looks ugly dude

Wait. The Cybertruck is all-wheel drive and not 4-wheel drive? Lol. Sticking to my wants of a Tacoma or F-150 in the future till Tesla gives a better design and 4wheel drive.

You are 100% correct. Trump will win in 2020! The economy is booming, people are happy(except the crying libs still bent over the election loss) and the Dems plan to impeach the president is backfiring. The loss will be for those who ignore these facts.

To be fair, it’s just a $100 refundable deposit. Who knows if I’ll want to/be in the position to buy it in 2+ years. It’s a sick truck imo so I’m hoping it’ll happen

This concept would fit their line up much better and also preserve their stock price. Some people think they can do what ever they want but eventually will learn the hard way no matter how much money they have. These people have certain obligations especially to share holders.

Tesla cyber truck = The Secret

Because I’ve been tweeting about this engineering abomination of a car I’m getting a lot of car ads now and I must say, Tesla is still the worst thing I’ve seen recently :) American version of Porsche Cayenne is a second, but far behind.

Currently, it's not street legal in the U.S. Needs outside rearview mirrors, different bumper structure, airbags, etc... What was shown was just a concept.

“You a Ram guy, or a Tesla guy?”

Wonder what @ Forbes problem is with Tesla and Elon lol. 146k unit sales in 24 hours is pretty .. “disappointing”. You’d think they’d help push sustainability unless some non renewable energy companies are in their pockets https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1198307730898980866 …

Hey @ elonmusk , from experience Consumer Identity Management at Tesla is not what it should be. The link Human - Identity - Car(s) and the belonging processes are lacking behind the state of the art appearance Tesla has. Shall we help?

He got attacked by Tesla nuts all day. They dragged me into it as well. He is probably really getting sick of them. The rabid gang going after journalists really, really doesn't work well for them.

Well, I live near Paris. Was at Atlanta last week and went in 2 Tesla Stores... Sorry

@ elonmusk @ Tesla @ Teslarati @ Model3Owners @ TeslaModel3News I preordered the TriMotor Truck. But will I get all the purchased accessories to my performance 3 anytime before the truck comes. Spoiler and Badges??

Then unfortunately Tesla will. Lose my truck business to Rivian. I'll still get my Model 3 and Model S though.

What and see for what? What I’ve stated is fact. The Cyber Truck as it is right now is literally illegal to drive on the roads. MANY things will have to he changed, and by that time it won’t even look like Cyber Truck. Not to mention, Tesla stock tanked after its unveil.

I’m gonna tell my kids this never made it past production

I love that it's ugly! When it fails to sell I'll be able to buy a 2 year old Tesla for $8,000. I won't care that it's ugly just cuz it's cheap and efficient. Lol

That’s true but they now have 146,000 x $100 = 14.6 million in cash for a car like you said that probably won’t come true. No updates on Tesla Semi or Tesla roadster. The sheep are being fleeced in broad daylight

But don’t you think compared to other unveils even with a polarizing out of world design Tesla was able to attract reservations. Next M3 moment for Tesla. If they don’t run to production hell then they would make money from the start.

Dengan persona “Tony Stark in real life”-nya, Elon Musk sekarang berada di posisi bisa jual apa aja bakal laris karena produk2nya jadi nampak keren. Bayangin aja sebagai bos Tesla & Space X dia berhasil jualan topi, semprotan api & truk kotak2.

I can't help but feel that assuming that every $100 refundable deposit would turn into an actual sale is being rather optimistic.

Is de lead designer van Tesla die ook de model 3 & S heeft ontwikkeld. Misschien moet je wat meer artikels lezen, er is weldegelijk een reden voor dit design... De body blijkt heel goedkoop te vervaardigen. Het is eens iets anders dan wat anderen uitbrengen. Futuristisch ook!

Lol what I understand from $ TSLAQ camp is anything Tesla announces is a pump. While others can advertise, concept-car unveils, take reservations, even claim to do autonomous cars in 2 yrs while none of their cars can even do a simple lane change but that’s busn as usual. https://twitter.com/AngelNDevil2/status/1198370494896050176 …

I suspect that the ATV was still developed by Tesla, even though it appears to be using parts from an existing Yamaha ATV. It is common for vehicles developed by one company to share subsystems with another company's vehicle, like the old Tesla Roadster or new Toyota Supra.

@ elonmusk is a degenerate narcissist who's wealth was inherited not earned like true entrepreneurs like Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. If Tesla smart they would disassociate themselves with him immediately.

that’s where we break, then. whichever strategy, can’t see how the numbers wouldn’t be better for a design with wider appeal. rivians are interesting, but start 30K north of the tesla which prices them out for your average buyer. major opportunity lost here, IMO.

*17 years. Those were the years without competition and it couldn't make a profit even then. Now competition is here. And Tesla is an auto manufacturer (capital intensive and low margin, like all the others) and has no tech-style economies of scale.

Lots of good reading on what’s behind the design. The rationale includes an exoskeleton that is cheaper, faster, more capital efficient to produce — with lower weight. So maybe polarizing but imminently producable. Brilliant, as usual. And shocking.

Mr Wonderful loves money. His house could be burning and he’d be counting up the insurance money.

Thoughts on the Tesla truck: - Prior to day of launch, pictures were alright; resembled futuristic art a lot - Videos did not impress though - Truck definitely seems out of the ordinary It's not a truck though; wouldn't be useful for that work. # tesla # teslapickup # teslatruck

You have a book? if you had a book you’d tweet other stocks not just $ TSLA. You’re just an amateur thinking you’ll get rich fast shorting Tesla and got creamed in the mean time.

I did have that question as well but in the US "Truck" are classified differently to cars so perhaps this will make sense there? But I just don't Euro NCAP giving this a pass esp in the pedestrian department. It will literally slice people in half...or run them over

No, of course not, they’ll use sail boats made from fiberglass, plastic, and other fibers that are processed using and contain refined materials from coal, natural gas & other fossil fuels. Or they’ll drive their Tesla’s that contain batteries that are way worse for environment.

So your telling me Tesla just roped in $5.46 billion in sales already?

It's very low What people don't realize is that Tesla has tens of millions of unrealized revenue it can't cash from Model 3 reservation deposits who never committed to buying the car These $100 reservations don't mean conversions Even if sold it's <4% US annual truck sales

Hoping they can get regulations changed to allow cameras instead of mirrors. And Tesla has already done amazing things in engineering. They'll figure out the crash test.

Not yet. But chances well above zero that Tesla assumes iPhone-like position in new age cars.

I guess my read is they kinda have to to survive. No easy way to 1-1 swap truck drivers onto electric, and they need all of the customers they can get. Large cars impact on pedestrian and bike safety does worry me, but I just think Tesla is uniquely illsuited for the problem

If Tesla keeps the Cyber Truck design with a roll up door storage space between the back axel and battery packs it’s a major design flaw and very dangerous. http://www.jeepproblems.com/rear-impact-fire/ …

It's almost like Tesla and Elon have done it before. The exact same play.

I think Tesla is a rocket company that goes to Mars by selling cars.

People buy Pickup Trucks because they are Functional, Tough and Cheap. I think what many are missing about the Tesla Pickup is that, it doesn't look the way it looks because they started with the styling, it looks that way because it's Functional, Tough and Cheap @ elonmusk

I disagree...or @ elonmusk must be hell of an actor. His presentation completely changed after that glass broke. Before he was confident and composed, after his body language changed, he got red cheeks and started to stutter.

People shit on the Tesla’s new truck’s window breaking but bulletproof doesn’t mean unbreakable and it sure as shit doesn’t mean it could take a round from an AK. Also car windows are supposed to break so you’re not trapped in and burned alive.

Well said & raised some great points. Thank you

Unless mainly those who drive well above average distances in a year replaced their ICE vehicles with Teslas. Then it might not be so bad.

@ elonmusk I don’t know if you have come up with a name for the @ Tesla truck yet but how about the “Tesla 180”

Elon Musk says Tesla has received nearly 150,000 orders for its new electric pickup truck since the automaker revealed the futuristic vehicle earlier this week to mixed reviews. https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/11/23/musk-says-orders-tesla-cybertruck-strong/ …

The much-hyped unveiling of Tesla’s electric pickup truck went off script Thursday night when supposedly unbreakable window glass splintered twice when hit with a large metal ball. http://bit.ly/2DcU0Ox

The cybertruck confirms a few things: 1) Tesla is Supreme for mid-life crises 2) The highest order aesthetic is utilitarian form with luxury (read: minimal) function 3) Elon is panicking

You gotta be open minded bro.. would you really just want another truck looking truck.. Gm, ford, Ram and Toyota make them and if you take the signs off you cant tell the difference.. you know this is a tesla without a sign on it

Tesla now has 10% of the truck market, after ~2 days. Total failure.

I couldn’t tell what the size was from the pics & price point. Interesting

Éste es el básico, el más famoso es el Tesla modelo 3 y el X (que es el más grande), éste nuevo que han sacado parece bastante más grande que el model X, por lo que no entraría en ninguna plaza de aparcamiento.

When’s it come out?

Why would someone spend their money on a Tesla cybertruck that shit is UGLY

I was shocked as every other Tesla is a meeting too boring design the cybertruck isn't. It's a gamble that will pay off

Why the holy hell have 146,000 people ordered that friggen Tesla truck thing or whatever it is? I’m still not convinced it isn’t a really early or really late April fools joke.

Hard to see how Tesla could reduce cars on the road. Maybe making an electric bike, but car usage is a super difficult problem primarily downstream of policy. Hopefully people like @ ryanmjohnson make headway

Does Tesla do incentives, or do they sell everything at MSRP? Do you think there would've been any fleet sales in those numbers?

That’s the color I want!!! Matt black!!! Thank you @ elonmusk

Feel kinda bad to because Tesla stock has dipped and most people are seeing Elon as a joke/failure. Would buy in to the dip tho I’m a huge Tesla fan

Are other features planned? Like winch, roof cage, variable inflation tyres system or RGB lights inside (maybe outside too? ;) )? Would make the @ Tesla # cybertruck a bit more fun ;)

Lustigt ändå att både mercedes och bmw kör targeted ads nu när man sökt lite på cybertruck. Allt medans Tesla litar på organiska delningar och memes. Lite ok boomer över det hela.

If Tesla wasnt able to be altered from the cloud, I would choose Tesla That being the case, F-150 it is

147,000 orders? Still ugly, but as long as it sells and makes Tesla a good profit -

That new Tesla truck ain’t it.

Tesla fell into the Jony Ive trap when designing this “truck”. It doesn’t address any need or concern of someone who would buy a truck. But they think it looks cool.

A dude from tesla is trying to recruit me and like nah son, I ain't gonna work for a WORSE company. I've heard nothint but horror stories from that fucking factory.

I'd go for a Rivian R1T pickup all day over one of those. If I had the money!!

So, not being a ‘brainwashed trump sycophant’ is considered a “narrative” these days....

The styling gets in the way of being a truck tho, you can't really load it from the side with that crazy body work. I guess its fine for people that just drive a truck because they drive a truck, but it's not going to beat the Ford if it isn't a work truck. And it isn't.

Where did you get this spy shot of the production # Cybertruck? @ Tesla

No, it’s a Yamaha Raptor, they didn’t build it. There’s a reason there’s no details.

It seems like they built a vehicle around the idea of what a truck means to people, like if you want a truck that is powerful and safe, what can beat a fully armored truck that can do 0-60mph in 2.9s, and the design... “c’mon it’s a Tesla a car from the future!” # Teslarobloxpic.twitter.com/Lyx2qgIWiI

What conspiracy theory? A fascist coup took place in a country with lots of lithium. Tesla, a company that requires lithium, saw their stock prices skyrocket as a direct result. Tesla is profiting off the murder of indigenous people.

Yeah, Tesla's FSD computer is detached from any sort of network connectivity and has no antennae. It's literally impenetrable except through physical access, and even then the encryption and locked firmware are effectively impenetrable as well.

I'm trading my crZ for one, because I need a truck to pull with, & that's what they are used for in my family, pulling & transport tool's.

My theory: @ Tesla knew the window would break. Knew that moment would go viral and meme, while being easy to fix. 4D chess! https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198347240785338368 …

Come on!! I know you have good taste. That one is ugly as hell!!!

Well not really. Thats 146k in zero obligation $100 reservations. And Ford sells 1Million a year. The first Tesla trucks wont start rolling out for 2yrs, which is 2million F150 in the meantime Then you add in the other truck makers(approx 1.6M/yr) It's more like 4% market

Tesla has launched new pick up truck. This is what electrical vehicle should be FUN. Shaped like 21 sentry Landrover, I cant why understand media is putting it down, this car is going to be hit!

Why did you have a swat team try to kill a Tesla whistleblower

No, no it will not. And I like Tesla. But not this.

Enjoyed listening to you! Your in-depth knowledge of the market is impressive. A smart successful businessman that understands that President Trump has created the best ever economy for workers and business owners! Common Sense!!

Fun fact - you know that Apple supposedly wanted to buy Tesla. You know one of their conditions? To kick out Musk. Apple didn’t want him anywhere near their operations. They dont need fake marketing If it’s good for Apple, it’s good for me

Tesla isn’t a car company. They’re a battery company.

Tesla's cybertruck early numbers show the value of what brand equity is. Even when your product isn't received well by some experts in the area the masses see it very differently. Value of incumbents in a sector

I do camp but not hardcore camper myself either. I just want to be with nature for a weekend or so not so too deep in to nature kinda person. This works for that for sure.

Like Tesla's Semi-Truck line, I see the most application for the Cybertruck as a contracted mass order vehicle - however, for military and law enforcement. It is more durable, powerful and spacious than the Explorer, and is faster on the highway than the Charger.

Historically the "concept" cars of Tesla have turned out pretty similar to their production versions. Tho I admit that this one has a higher probability of change than previous models

It's a more complicated question than the way you phrased it. Will it be profitable? Tesla has lost money every year it existed. Giving away $1 for 90 cents gets a lot of customers. But it isn't going to save Tesla. Success is becoming a profitable, sustainable company.

We now know that in Feb 2016 before this article, Kimbal Musk had received multiple margin calls against his Tesla and SolarCity stakes. Musk was likely close to a margin call as well in early Feb 2016 which likely motivated his decision to pull forward the unveiling of the M3

Yeah it's called bluing. They do that with guns for instance

I'm trying so hard to like the # Tesla Cybertruck, but I just cant get beyond its design. Its exterior could challenge the Pontiac Aztek as the worst design in the history of auto manufacturing. Now Elon Musk says 146k Cybertruck orders are confirmed. Yikes. # ev # ElectricVehicles

When tesla announced that the truck would be highly functional, I assumed they would back that up. There is no even surface to attach roof racks. Such a simple thing. And drilling into an exoskeleton is probably not recommend let alone functional or practical.

The shipping industry was hooked in late 2017 and early 2018. Once it became clear the 3 was chaos in the production build up, you've seen bets shift from Tesla to BYD, Nikola, Freightliner and others. Credit to Musk for pushing electric on Class 8 biz though.

I for one love the new Tesla truck design. It'll be like being in an 80's Sci-fi movie set in the year 1999!

But, I’d consider the Cybertruck bc while it’d certainly be excessive in size, it would not be excessive in its carbon footprint. Other than electric being 0 emission, Tesla’s are increasingly being charged off the grid and purely through solar.

I was ready to stop making jokes linking car culture and comically insecure menchildren whose favorite pastime is gazing at their penis in the magnifying mirror on their wife's vanity set, but the CEO of Tesla deciding that the car of the future needs to be a tank is not helping.

Tesla learned from some mistakes. They’re delivering the Model Y earlier than originally forecast. I expect deliveries for the Cybertruck to start in late 2021 and possibly earlier if they announce new battery production in-house at Battery & Powertrain investor day.

I think @ elonmusk really wanted some people to hate the Tesla Truck. Like What the F*ck!!!??? Its like... Its like... Aww screw it! *drops mic and walks away* *peeps back in* give it point for originality though.

بالعكس مارد عليها وضحها ، كلنا متفقين إنها حركة جذب وتسويق جباارة ولها تأثيرها ، ولكن هل هي مبيعات حقيقية ؟ لا . أعتقد هذا القصد

I refuse to believe anyone actually thinks the Tesla truck looks cool. I think people who say they think it looks cool are saying it to be ~edgy or they’re just Elon fanboys. Like.. that shit is an eyesore.

Maybe! Musk certainly has enough on his plate for now, however. Model Y, Semi, Roadster, solar, Powerpacks, Powerwalls, Boring tunnels, SpaceX, and now a… BladeRunner. I'm curious to know, of those who have ordered one, how many are truck owners vs. already Tesla owners…?

Does Elon preface the fact that the truck won't even remotely resemble the concept due to design and safety regulations?

That the authors don’t include Nikola Tesla’s works and that they think we still have to use fuel instead of electro gravitics and mass reduction technology. That people think we are the most intelligent life in the universe. That other worlds use money.

If you guessed nearly 1/3rd of NASAs entire budget just in presales you’d be right, and regular Tesla’s already exist so these people were waiting for this thing.

You can count on that.

Seems that @ LEGO_Group 's been helping the design department of @ Tesla. You go, # cybertruck.

Yes!! So cool

The @ tesla cybertruck disappointed me at first sight but.... The iPad was not a flaming success in the beginning. This truck will have a cool factor like none other. It will sell like crazy. Watch.

Tesla would have to know the looks would be polarizing. I figured they’re not even trying to design for current pickup owner.

I love how everyone is jumping on the 'but the window broke' bandwagon... or 'it's so different it's ugly'.... But yet.... $14million received in cash deposits on new orders in less than 24 hours... @ elonmusk @ Tesla # cybertruck # takemymoney

Exactly, like what Tesla is doing with electric cars. But that doesn’t give you a clean slate. We are running out of time and you can’t hope that scientists will figure it out because it may be to late. I’m not saying be a 100% carbon neutral but just be mindful :)

Advertising is a waste of money for Tesla today. The supply can't keep up with the demand right now, without any advertising. All advertising would do at this point, is just create huge wait queues and a lot of unhappy and unsatisfied customers.

Guys the new # Cybertruck released by @ Tesla is the example of don’t judge the book by its cover. It’s super futuristic looking, it’s super quick, first ever electric pickup truck, the technology in it is amazing and it’s for affordable price. Great job @ elonmusk Again.

he did, 146k iirc

It won’t happen with the average truck buyer, per se. That’s an extremely loyal market. But you add in new/fringe truck buyers, and the new truck market it just created...it’s going to make other trucks look very, very pedestrian

Don't count your chickens before any eggs have been laid. Also a $100 deposit is hardly a commitment to buy.

I don't think so I mean they taking orders based on that design already.

146,000 Cybertruck orders so far. Should be pretty easy for Tesla to fill since the polygon count is lower.

I agree this truck was made for the US market ... and I also agree the model 3 and the soon to be model Y are the bedrock of what makes Tesla great ... I disagree with your characterization of the model 3 as being too big or too expensive however ...

Yes that's his dream and desire. Let's see what's happen in each market. If Tesla is private company owned by him whatever fail or success, it shouldn't be a problem. But Tesla is public company, result / if user like is the only way to justify investors.

It didn't fail he decided not to run. If he decided to continue he would have won the leadership of his party and had a good chance of becoming PM Dodged a bullet there.

The sail pillars are required to add stiffness to allow the unibody to tow. The battery is offset forward to account for weight in the bed. I'm so sick of everybody thinking that after seeing it for 2 days they can out think @ woodhaus2 and the entire @ tesla crew.

This is most people’s reaction from my circle of friends. Lots of loyal truck guys wanted to order the cyber truck, but couldn’t get over the design. If the design was a bit more normal looking, the orders would have probably been 1,460,000 not 146,000. Big mistake by Tesla IMO

New Tesla trucks looks futuristic like a Tron car, but my opinion looks ugly to me. I bet all the functions and features works great! But i can’t picture myself in it. Doesn’t look aggressively Americana to me. Like a raptor. # Myopinion

@ Kristennetten @ elonmusk @ Tesla what is with http://Tesla.com giving Access Denied responses ?

Hnngh. Laws of thermodynamics are not negotiateable. Adding generator spinners would just bring unnecessary complexity. For on-the-go charging, downhill energy collector (afaik there is one already) as well as inductive road (planned at least in Sweden) are IMHO better options.

I agree from an abstract point of view. But when it comes to human made products or designs it’s some how dealt differently.

Haven't you learned? Tesla have been creating the demand for their vehicles for nearly a decade now. The cybertruck is no different. Give it a couple years and other automakers will be playing catch up just like ford is trying to do now with their blatant Tesla Model 3 imitation

This is tesla you are talking about. It will be the safest truck on the road guaranteed.

It might work in the US market and I respect Elon’s genius, but the Model 3 is the lynchpin to an electric future, yet too big and expensive for the world market. The next Tesla should be like the Peugeot e208.

Sadly you can’t even buy Tesla’s in some states. Will have to wait and see if they ban features on them

I am massively confused on the design. With the style and design of Tesla why these hard lines? Why the long angle along the side of the bed? You eliminated any kind of load that may over hang a traditional bed. If there is something loaded that falls it now has angles to mash

Only if Tesla coming out with a motorcycle..

Since everyone is sharing their opinion on the @ Tesla # Cybertruck i suppose I will toss my two cents in. It's an early production model they showcased. I like the design. Innovation (whether good or bad) is useful in both ways. Tesla wants to continue innovating. I'm excited.

Feels like that will add ~$8B to Tesla revenue in 2021/2022. And what happens when Tesla starts advertising and self-driving comes out allowing an uber-like revenue stream? Are you kidding me? $2,000/share by 2022. Shorts get out now.

They are holding back on the Y, like the 3. It’s going to have some unannounced feature like FSD was announce after the Model 3 unveiling. It would kill current sales.

@ Tesla Haha. That’s about all it’s good for.. That’s the worst looking truck I’ve ever seen. Looks like a high school project or and over sized battlebot some kids made. As some who is an art major and went to Pasadena Art Center of Design I’m not impressed.

It’s not a “Truck” it’s a “Delorean.” Maybe in the “Future” when there is such a thing called Flying Cars with a different source of fuel, but NO, That THING is NOT A TRUCK. It’s a disgrace to the proud name of Truck, which is a working vehicle, NOT A SNOB!!!!!!

Patrick, guys like you make me not feel bad when these stocks collapse. I've heard this all before from cult followers of Shkreli and Tuzman. Enjoy the easy capital access market and when it eventually closes off for Tesla enjoy a repeat of WeWork. For now ride the volatility.

Don't need a license for a Tesla, they drive themselves

Delorean Truckaaahhh NO. Not a truck and I would buy it but I’ll have the diesel brothers smash it and crush it and send it back to Tesla and to tell them that their design team suck and they need their head examined. STOP WATCHING “BACK TO THE FUTURE MOVIES”

As a designer/artist, I'm surprised that @ Tesla actually unveiled that polygon on wheels. Have a little more pride than that, would ya? Like someone was paid to house life changing technologies in there? Don't get me wrong I love what Tesla has done to innovate but this? # DMDV

The reaction is amazing though. Tesla could show up with pieces of mangled metal tied together with duct tape, which self combusts into a cloud of toxic fumes, and the cultists would go "OMG THAT'S AMAZING IT'S 100 YEARS AHEAD OF ITS TIME PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY I'M BEGGING YOU".

So where can I download the new cyber truck? I don't see it on Tesla's website anywhere

I cant really disagree with what they are saying but it is a period piece and is probably accurate. As a car guy that is one of the famous stories and it looks well done. Maybe one day we can have the Tesla vs Lucid story but we are not there yet.

the tesla cybertruck looks like a lego block car bruh

basically what it really is. They fact that people are saying they are buying it just to buy it even though they don't need a truck or a car screams this. Also owners will probably be the majority of future Tesla vandalism victims once released. Just too easy of a target

Damn, I can't afford that now but I can see myself saving up for about 5 years for that when I do get a job. Too bad it'll be like the Model 3, where the base model was pretty much unavailable, as Tesla prioritizes the higher trims.

My first car was a @ ford Mustang. My current car is a @ tesla Model 3. Don’t waste your time a Ford dealership. Don’t waste your $ on any new car even. Save up till a used Model 3 fits your budget. With gas savings & less maintenance, this will be sooner than you think!

We'll see, I guess. Hope I'm wrong, but I think Tesla left a huge opening for someone to make a truck that actually looks like a truck that can do all the same things. Rivian comes to mind, but Ford is also obviously raising it's EV game. It was Tesla's for the taking. Now? Dunno

Based on how many cars per day or hours loading rate? I'm closer to ~50,000.

I think the conversion rate will be pretty low compared to the y and 3 as it's only $100 deposit and some people were putting down 2 or 3.

id like to see an elon musk debate betwixt you two . don’t let the banter become personal. i think it’s cool if you have allocation on the tesla cybertruck. firsthand honest review incoming on streamanity hopefully!

What are you talking about? They are neither significantly cash flow positive nor are they a young company. Cash is cash, and a car business takes A LOT of capex. Tesla isn't spending enough on maintenance much less growth and still burning cash.

Elon & Tesla crew just seem like a bunch of slackers to me! Botched event with that turned into a huge PR event with 146,000 orders for a truck to come out in 2 years. How long till it reaches 200,000 or 300,000 preorders?

Three possibilities: 1. Tesla pays YouTubers 2. Tesla buys Adsense on YouTube 3. Boog is lying I honestly don't know which is true but I don't see the incentive for Boog to lie there. I do think I jumped the gun with the accusation though.

I mean when you’re rich..

Will it fit

Sure, keep convincing yourself that everything is fine and Elon actions are normal. It will be sad at it end. No more Tesla tweeting.

No stat i just saw that incident on tv few months ago, a 22 or 24 years old girl was driving tesla n it was on auto drive but the function dis not work n the car ran over pedestrians n few got killed/injured

Tesla is not targeting the farmers and ranchers of the world with the Cybertruck.

My largest gripe with functionality of Tesla is that the idea of running most car features through a giant iphone screen is very unappealing to me. But I guess those of us who prefer toggle switches and dials are now very limited in number.

No brainer, Tesla.

Model 3 sales fell 39% in the US, their main market last QTR. this truck will never be produced. Just like the roadster and the Semi. It’s just marketing to pump the stock price - Tesla’s only real product.

That's true, but even so, if orders are financed and they rarely fall into default, that's quite a nice revenue stream for Tesla either way.

MSM is so funny. $8B in pre-orders, 146K pre-order vehicles in 24hrs, by the only company that can mass produce EV’s, and they call it a flop. The other auto’s don’t want mass pre-orders because they can’t mass produce. They have to go through production hell first. Not @ Tesla

Microsoft Windows OS, the person I was replying to posted a meme where supposedly a six year old elon drew this car, but elon was born in like '69 so the math is bad.

wow Elon Musk just fucked me with a Tesla condom and I am fully pregnant

Luckily the one in the picture is only the dual motor. The tri motor has a 14,000 towing capacity

No it shouldn’t be an issue, but Tesla Batteries take around 3,000 gallons of water to cool down so that’s an issue and that steel is going to be hard to cut with a K-12 or the jaws of life

New job starting December.. @ elonmusk I'ma have that Tesla soon. Might fuck around and snag the Cybertruck honestly.

I think there are more in the metro areas but Indiana is a rust belt state and it may be a little harder to convince people that EV’s are a viable option.

To me, the Tesla truck looks like an F-117 Stealth Fighter/Toyota Prius love child.

Forget tree stumps. I think a better video would be hooking up to and moving trucks who try icing our Tesla charging stations! By no means do I condone it but would be funny...possibly illegal...but funny.

I'm not a fan of the design, but I understand that it's a pivotal design change that might affect future car designs going forward. It looks interesting, to say the least. It's still a Tesla though so, it's gonna be super luxurious. In the end I still can't afford one .

Wow!!

A majority of the non blue-collar working force want that damn Tesla truck I see. GM had a Cadillac truck and bombed, why? Because it does not pay the bills to keep making them. Enjoy your rich clubs toy because that is all it is, a toy.

It's not a truck it hauls nothing?

That new Tesla truck beyond ugly

Maybe wait until they work out the kinks. Never really a good idea to buy first run. But I am too broke to buy one myself so Im biased.

Apparently 146,000 other people like the way you think. If this event was a # fail, I’m curious what success looks like?

Camping family trips? Safety? Likely that the steel and armor glass exterior will crush industry safety standards. I would expect Tesla foes to eventually argue that cybertruck is dangerous because it is a military like vehicle & poses a danger to normal vehicles in accidents.

All of it. You could pull all the equipments.

Tesla come to Brazil please

The fact that Tesla will be selling a 500 mile range vehicle with incredible performance for under 70k bucks in just three years is quite telling ... They should be able to manufacture a 25k hatchback profitably by then.

As the bairn says of the no brake pedal tesla tank. If you can afford a tesla, you can afford the lawsuits of crashing into ppl.

That is a perfect design for folks who otherwise would never buy a truck... Is more a sedan with a bed.. not to mention, EVERYONE will know you are hip/smart/cutting edge enough to own a Tesla..

Does the new Tesla only play vapor wave music when you drive @ elonmusk ?

you used to be a reliable skeptic, what happened to you. There are ~300k newly minted tesla owners this year alone and $100 earning no interest can be deployed to say to friends you have a “tri motor” beast in your future? it is such a joke even I considered it.

Armored glass was made from Glass sheets, plus interlayers and Polycarbonate, depends on the Armoring Level you want, the formulation of layers and glass thickness you choose. Not bad that exterior layers of glass breaks, the important thing is what happens inside the vehicle!

At first Im okay the new Tesla and then I was like nope it’s ugly. I changed my mind it looks like in the video games and I like it

Also, looking at the F150, there is nothing preventing you from setting up the tesla EXACTLY like that. The bed has a ramp built into the tail gate & it would be simple to use aftermarket products to install rails/racks/boxes exactly like that.

Yeah, im getting me a tesla truck.

Tim, why act like your not supposed to like it? Over 140k reservations man! A lot of people love it! Including me ofcource

First time I laid eyes on it, before hearing anything about it or even knowing it was @ Tesla, I thought “wow that’s a truck.” https://twitter.com/AJA_Cortes/status/1198101332810326018 …

Das Ziel einer Firma wie Tesla ist nicht, dass jedes Auto die perfekte Mobilitätsalternative ist. Tesla will auch PR machen, Kohle machen, verrückt sein. Man kann es auch übertreiben mit dem grünen Ehrgeiz lieber Robin.

Tesla has never revealed reservation numbers for the Model Y. Why is Musk now revealing reservation numbers for the Cybertruck? The last time Musk was desperately pumping reservation numbers, his financial empire was on the verge of collapse.

Elon ended up investing his own money as well as Spacex's money (in contravention of its own internal policies) into SCTY to prop it up so it could be acquired by Tesla

The equity offering prices at $215/share. In the equity offering, Elon Musk sold 2.8MM shares of Tesla stock for gross proceeds of ~$600MM. This is the only offering Musk has ever sold into. Tesla also sold 6.5MM shares in the offering as well.

After 6 weeks of pumping the "deposit" numbers, $ TSLA announced it was doing an equity offering on 5/18/2016. In the Prospectus for that offering, Tesla wrote " we held deposits from about 373,000 customers who had made reservations for this car."

In the Q1 2016 10-Q Tesla wrote " We unveiled Model 3 in the first quarter of 2016 and received more than 325,000 reservations for this vehicle within one week of its introduction."

Tesla Cybertruck reservations hit 146,000 http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/jT9WsDky9K0/ …

On 5/4/2016 Tesla announced that it was advancing forward production plans for the Model 3 and that it planned to produce 500,000 Model 3s in 2018. In reality, the company ended up producing 152,977 Model 3s in 2018.

No. But only because I’m not a truck or SUV person and I’m perfectly content with my Model 3. Other than trading up to a Performance 3 in a couple of years I don’t see myself switching to anything else.

Later on 4/1/2016 Musk tweeted that the company had 232k orders for the Model 3. https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/01/why-teslas-model-3-is-blowing-away-expectations.html … On 4/7/2016 Tesla issued a statement to the media stating that it had 325k deposits for the Model 3 https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/07/tesla-motors-reports-325k-deposits-for-model-3.html …

The Model 3 was "unveiled" and started taking deposits on 3/31/2016. At the unveiling event, Musk announced Tesla had 135k orders for the Model 3. On 4/1/2016 Musk tweeted that Tesla had 180k orders for the Model 3 and then later tweeted that Tesla had 198k orders.

Elon I would like to personally thank you for putting your foot in the ass of all the automakers because they deserve it. It's about time we get out of the stone age with these petroleum driven automobiles. To everyone reading this tweet please do your part and support Elon.

The only reason I would get a mat black or any other colour @ Tesla # CyberTruck is so the scratches would be visible and it would look like it was well used. Else I’m going stainless steel and original. Scratches add value to the truck IMHO.

I was flummoxed at first, couldn't figure out what Musk's strategy was, then it hit me. I think Musk knew that a lot of core p/up buyers would not go for a Tesla. Musk/Tesla strategy: Create a truck that the Tesla buyer market WOULD buy - define, create & own a new truck market

Honestly...he could have IT and I would drive a Y in a perfect scenerio. But I like the truck more then him, so go figure. But, I also do not want to get rid of my old Tesla..I love her too much.

the new tesla truck looks like the first tomb raider on playstation graphics

Why didn’t it have a bed if it is a truck?

Of course it was set in Nitra, Slovakia... Not too far from Košice where you actually are.

Even tho it’s ugly, I’ll probably still own one at some point. Tesla is about the future, not the now https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

If it was a @ Tesla it would be world news. Because it’s a Cadillac, news media ignores the dangerous flammable liquid it runs on.

Tesla is doing a ton of battery and manufacturing research. They know that cars are not the core problem. Focus on the 2nd derivative to get at acceleration.

Not an official product (yet), but I know some fans of both @ LEGO_Group and @ Tesla that this would interest. cc: @ john_m_neffhttps://twitter.com/vincent13031925/status/1198339645127311360 …

Actually the shape was driven by manufacturing costs.

I'd sell my left arm for this truck if I didnt need it for work, but my biggest worry with this thing is actually getting it insured. Will Tesla be adding side mirrors? Does the lack of crumple zone increase the risk of whiplash? ...and does it come in green?

The first day they turned the smart summon feature on a guy's Tesla immediately drove directly into the side of his garage, but yeah, safety is paramount for Elon

you seem mad bro. I agree with your stances but Christ, if you’re not able to take other peoples criticisms, you’re the weak one. If it’s annoying->don’t reply. If they’re trolls baiting for attention->don’t give them any. I still stand by my point->bitch tier maneuver.

After seeing that Tesla I just look at cars as a big metal box on wheels.

And just like that.... everyone forgot about the Mach-E Thank you @ Tesla # ford # Mustangmache

Sounds like a reasonable deduction

It’s crazy how everyone that’s a climate climate evangelist also talks shit about Tesla when, like, you drive a gas car? You do see the issue there right?

Is this going to be the safest tesla ever? Autopilot? Where are the cameras going to be? How much will this vehicle weigh? Crash test results? Did you put in any crumple zones? Exoskeleton, sounds great, does it mean if it gets into an accident there will be frame damage? Many??

The only way I would buy something that fugly is if it came in purple and black.

Whyyyyyyyy

I think the funny thing about the Tesla truck design or whatever is how much we've unconsciously come to prefer less angular car designs because that's been standard in the industry for so long

Had a 25 year career in auto industry & have to say that Tesla Cybertruck is the ugliest thing I have seen since the Pontiac Aztek (still can't believe an Executive in GM actually put their signature to a document to authorize building it, and wasting $1billion on it)!

Yes they seem very early! I just wonder if the Chinese Government will prop them up. Their stock is around 100x cheaper than Tesla's = NIO.

@ elonmusk Yo, since the cybertruck was announced, when will we get a cybertruck looking Tesla cybercycle

Would you consider buying a Tesla vehicle if Tesla were to make the investment to have dealerships, service centers and super chargers in Trinidad and Tobago?

LOL. It’s soooo ugly but TBH, I know the drive and performance would be amazing and I would trade a lot for the performance of a Tesla.

Couldn't resist. Being the Sci-Fi fool that I am, I just reserved my # Tesla # Cybertruck 4 what may be the absolute dumbest reasons to purchase a vehicle. Off 2 watch Terminator, The Martian, Batman, Aliens, Blade Runner. And, is that the owl inspired by "Clash of the Titans"?pic.twitter.com/g99QUCOZEp

I wonder if the Terminator @ Schwarzenegger has ordered @ Tesla CyberTruck yet. Would be a nice ride for a future movie too. Cameo from @ elonmusk maybe?

I know. Elon Musk is just trolling the wealthy at this point who will pay anything if it has a Tesla brand!

Did you see the demo where the unbreakable window was broken? It made for a lot of lols.

Cool how you figure out 59k , I've no business ordering on financial grounds but did anyway to support Tesla plus see the full self driving like a extra health insurance policy and need 4×4 anyway.

Expensive coffin is what it is.

are people putting a down payment on the tesla truck because they’re actually interested or because they want to stunt

Infinitely so on nothing more than the specs alone. Throw in that it’s a pure EV and now there’s simply nothing on this planet to reasonably compare this to - even at its least expensive trim. Thanks @ tesla @ elonmusk

The tesla truck is really growing on me..

@ elonmusk and @ Tesla. While the # Cybertruck does look like an old school apple mouse, I’m impressed at the range, top speed, and towing capabilities of it. All at a pretty good price for an EV. I’m rooting for you guys!

Rivian

A lot of truck owners that I’ve known care much more about functionality than design. Can it tow? How much can you fit in the truck bed? How durable is it? I’m thinking it might be a different type of Tesla owner that buys this truck, not like the ones who buy the other models.

LiOH*H2O for batteries for all ~150,000 @ Tesla cybertrucks ordered to date ~10,000 tonnes = ~3-4X annual production from US's currently only operating lithium mine.

After seeing the Tesla truck makes me wonder what the cars in a couple years will look like

LoL, okay.... I get what you're doing, but 99% of 1/2 tons keep the original bed. If you want to argue there is 1% here and there that wouldn't want to keep the original bed, you're right, but I don't see how that will affect sales of a new truck off a lot.

@ Tesla @ elonmusk Has there been any thoughts into adding front and/or rear recovery hooks to move stuff on the # Cybertruck ? Is there any possibility of a snowplow or any way to mount one? A stainless steel snow plow wouldn't be a bad idea for the rust belt.

As many of them that have caught on fire? I always park on the other side of the parking lot when I see a Tesla.

If the StVZO has not been changed in the last decade, the answer is no: wheels are not allowed to extend beyond the fender. You need to mod the body if you want to install wider wheels, and then need an ABE for both mods IIRC.

oh didn’t know that, pretty cool ngl

Yep, but if you consider for a second that in theory it doesn't seem to be impossible to deliver this 'payload' to the cars nationwide by simply buying an ad time on the national radio... Isn't that a scary thought?

If I'm not mistaken the Leaf had less than 20000 initial reservations and it has sold an average of 50000 cars per year or so. CNBC was saying that tesla will sell 50000 a year, I think it's going to be much more. Will see how much more.

Reminds me of the "$250,000 Tesla Roadster" that, could do 0-60 in 1.9 secs and, onto a top speed in excess of 250 mph. And, not to mention had 4 seats. It was supposed to be better than a Chiron in every way (according to Tesla fanboys). Whatever happened to all of that bs?

So far as I can see, its expansion. If Tesla were VAG, at 6 million units a year or thereabouts, it would be trying to increase production using that income to 20 million+ units, by 2021. Even VAG would make a loss on those numbers.

They haven’t made $8bn... they still need to build a plant, find funding, make the bloody trucks and deliver them before those orders are cancelled. They made $14m.

It’s the magnetic affect. Tesla batteries create a strong enough force to pull drivers to the open spot next to any Tesla. They are unable to fight the force of physics and give up thinking it’s their own choice.

Wenn es stichhaltige Beweise gäbe müsste er doch nicht Geld über gofundme für das Verfahren sammeln. zudem ist der Report über ein Jahr alt und nicht "neu" https://twitter.com/awinston/status/1198281740852322304 …

@ elonmusk I ordered one. Never owned a pickup truck or a @ Tesla but that cybertruck is some next level sh*t

100% agree, most Truck. Becareful tho Cause Tesla fanboys gonna pounce. 100% agree, I’m a Tesla fan and own a 3 and ordered the Y. This design is just atrocious.

@ elonmusk The @ oshawacity has a huge vehicle assembly plant coming available in approx 30 days. It would be mind blowing to see huge @ Tesla signs all over the city! Need electricity? What better than 2 nuclear power plants. 1 on either side of the Factory. Love to have you!

Not to add to the shit youre getting but him and h3h3 talked about it on ethan and hilas podcast. Casey said he was offered money to promote a different electric car but he turned it down because he likes his tesla so much and they both said they wished they (tesla) did ads

I can't tell you how good that makes me feel about being a bull with Tesla. like how dumb do you have to be to write something like that publicly and you're considered a journalist.

That's what I've been reading, RIP.

My best friend just preordered the new Tesla truck and I can’t wait to experience it with exactly 0 financial responsibility

Tesla is all in on lithium batteries which I think is a mistake. A big truck could have hardened hydrogen tanks, which when low can be refueled quickly. Also, think stainless steel over body on frame seems odd.

The Tesla Truck was not designed by truck people. I kinda think Tesla is trapped by it battery electric paradigm. An electric truck powered by a fuel cell and hydrogen makes a lot of sense. Especially for towing.

It's Tesla knowing their market & reaching their target audience pic.twitter.com/volXUUNbtH

Because electricity and charging stations would@be all over the place and still working right?

No. You’re thing is electric. You’re thing is batteries. You’re not a hover car. This thing looks gross. Try again.

No mirrors when towing wide trailers such as the enclosed one in the tesla scetch you won't have rear viability. The rasorback design limits accces to the bed to rear only, so no toolbox or slip tank (for fueling equipment) or side loading or checking tie-downs.

Ok this is really growing on me. I find it to be a very good looking pick up truck! # Tesla https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1198343931005505536 …

Is there a reason why there isn’t a “Tesla” logo on it? Seeing as the Tesla “T” logo is curved, you should make a unique one for the cybertruck.

pretty wild to think that i can almost afford the tesla cybertruck, it would be pretty useful for me since i live in the US for oblivious reasons happening outside

Magically the DeLorean from Back To The Future resembles this truck, but build quality seems to be lacking with the Tesla truck. I would go with @ Rivian that is known to work and has far higher chances of not being just ”marketing”.

I think the range will be good enough especially with the 500 mile version. Problem that I see is trying to charge while towing anything. Need superchargers with more pull through spots that can accommodate 40’ trailers.

How are these equal? a Tesla uses oil in the manufacturing process for steel, tires and plastics ( a dozen barrels or so ?) for a lifetime use of less than 1 liter per 100 km. Average Canadian car get 8.9 liters per 100 km. An Airbus A220 get 2 liters per 100 km per passenger

Third concept is more radical in that this could be used as a base for “invisibility” basic lines and projection of images could render it invisible. Density scans could remove radar invisibility but minimal angles always implies potential. # TeslaPickupTruck # teslatruck # tesla

it's true, noone expected an electric cyberCOFFIN from Tesla. Unless reversed, this design language will kill the whole company very fast. Sales will come to a screeching halt

Tesla is the Next Big thing. It's revolutionary. Efficient. Magnificent. # EmeryOut

@ elonmusk I can see how they will call you the killer of combustion engine! BOLD! Glad that @ Tesla board gives you the needed support in this extreme hard battle!

Tesla Cybertruck design is brilliant. It ensures everybody knows you have a Tesla Cybertruck. No confusion. Just because they are not designed to look attractive does not mean the are not designed well.

@ elonmusk how fast does the new tesla truck charge?

A truck designed out of a box, looks like a beast & affordable to everyone. Tesla has reinvented the wheels. - No complains

Order a Tesla truck??

Thought of the Day: That new Tesla truck design is trash. Throw it away and start over. # ThoughtOfTheDay # cybertruckfail

You’re spot on in the analysis, but Tesla only cares about the appearance of creating new product categories in making it seem like there is demand for their products, not actually delivering on any of this because they don’t have the money

Sure but I just feel like people in the $ TESLAQ movement generally push away people by jumping on shit like this and not talking about what matters. Tesla has real weaknesses that people should know but on Twitter all you hear is THE ATV wtfff

No lie that Tesla truck ugly as hell,but I’m sure ppl gonna want it cuz of the name.

I put money down to buy a @ Tesla CyberTruck as well! Ready to add some camping gear and racks for my scuba tanks! haha

Yeah so? Tesla has $100 deposit for all other vehicles they are selling now. They are selling ~360k per year of those. They are selling far more per year of M3s than those initial preorders of M3 which turned into 150k.

I would love a Cybertruck... I'm so happy and grateful my wife was on board with the purchase of a # Tesla # Model3, but if I were to bring another vehicle home I'm not sure I'd live to see another day lol.

I love it, I would have one but it's just too big. I laughed when I first saw it, but it grows on you. And I'm not a tesla lover or hater, I just appreciate the utility aspects of it. It's a working truck, not a fashion statement.

I love Tesla but this truck doesn’t do what I need it to, I know I’m in the minority but I was really hoping for a heavy duty truck to be able to really haul with, that way I didn’t have to register it with the DOT because it’s such a large vehicle...

Yes, but can they deliver on them? The old orders are not even finished Tesla halo effect seems fishy to me

Bro it’s the ugliest thing ever. The point of a truck is to utilize its advantages and get dirty. 99.9% of purchasers will buy due to the Tesla name. And at that point why not just buy the car? I want a truck to get dirty and go have fun

That construct exists for a reason: functionality. Easy all around bed access being one. Ability to put a topper on it or a roof/ladder rack. Trucks are tools that fit specific needs. Being “cool” because we’re told it’s “cool” is not going to work on the true truck crowd.

The fact that tesla had balls to demonstrate it live tells a lot about how you much they believe in the product. Ordered mine.

Can @ Tesla have a Black Friday deal...

. @ Tesla’s new truck seems to rip off a design that was cool back in 1985 or “the future,” if you will... but instead of being cool it’s overly harsh, bulletproof (...not!), and seems to be some strange villain vehicle from a dystopian future sci-fi film.

Lol literally thousands of blue check marks say positive things about tesla and never say they're getting paid. You really think if there was a sliver of evidence they were getting paid and not disclosing it, it wouldn't be SUPER easy to catch them. Fucking moron.

I love # Tesla but the new Cybertruck makes me think # elonmusk is right about the simulation and there’s a # glitch in # thematrix

It’s just a 100.00 deposit. Not like there’s much to loose if someone was to order one and then change their mind.

I may be wrong about the truck not being street legal, but I’m told cars must have side mirrors and a center breaklight, which I believe the # Cybertruck does not. $ TSLA @ Tesla

Not disagreeing, and the range isn't fantastic - just working within your limits. We need more affordable electric cars in Australia... As much as I think it's ugly, the Tesla ute looks beaut price wise in the US, $35k usd.

On the one hand, yes, but on the other hand Tesla was frankly a bag of dicks himself and really neither of them are worth lauding.

this Tesla truck..

I wonder how well this would sustain secondary systems - displays, AC, etc.. If your going to the middle of nowhere - have that sort of secondary use covered might be a blessing. Or if what can will into running out of juice in the middle of the Colorado Rockies.

Hey Elon, you need to design a lumber rack for this truck.

Dude, same here. I actually hated it with a passion when I saw it haha. Now I love it and want one! I think the presentation threw me off. It would have benefited them to show the truck more (inside/capabilities) instead of cheap tricks, in my opinion. First impressions and all.

Warranty service on your bricked Model 3?

@ Tesla @ elonmusk You should definitely hire this guyhttps://youtu.be/3Ytm_GnTkl0

LOVE!!!!!

They also rode so smooth. Made Amtrak feel like I had riden on horseback previously.

Tesla really just sent me a contract this shits confusing. @ elonmusk so if I don’t have the money in time how tf am I supposed to buy the truck. Not everyone balling as hard as u, I’m still chasing the bag.

I had the same idea, a child's drawing turned into a truck. (And I like the truck now, and am also a fan of Tesla).

You are aware that you have been wrong about Tesla for years and all you do is move the goalposts right? You should straight hater and don't have an open mind.

Price is a bit high for the 4x4 option.. Not much sense in buying a truck for snow states if it's a three season vehicle. Or even basic offraod usage or pulling a boat out of the water. 2x4 slips so much on wet ramps.

That rear end is just so awful! I’m so disappointed with it, I was adement I was trading in the MX for the new TESLA pickup until seeing it. Even if the rear corners were shaped at 45 deg it would look less like a shoe box. Rest of the truck im coming round to but that rear.

1/3... Which of these three would you pick? Had an absolutely awesome time at the @ GeelongRevival yesterday with the folks at Custom Plates.

Interesting - this provides a new Event card for the Gray Eminence Board game. Tesla and Musk have surely made it not-so-difficult to find problems that COULD have been tackled. https://twitter.com/cstross/status/1198203255475638279 …

Was wondering that too. As Tesla say it’s a production vehicle, but it doesn’t have any obvious exterior review mirrors/camera stalks or a windscreen wiper!

A study from advisory firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence last year concluded that from the early days of the Model S to the Model 3, Tesla was able to reduce its cobalt consumption by an average of 59% per vehicle.

You’re dumb asf if you try to argue with me about Tesla’s.

To appease the naysayers @ Tesla should come out with a Model 3 ute. They can do that quickly, scale production and target markets as needed, and induce very little cost and risk.

I'm really not liking the look of this truck. Usually Tesla are so sleek, but it does look like something out of a scifi movie: Tesla Cybertruck Debuts With Sci-Fi Personality And Gobs Of Power # Cybertruck # teslatruck # scifi # sciencefiction https://www.motor1.com/news/383777/tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-debut/ …pic.twitter.com/a5DNsER3Jq

Haha. Elon Musk och hans Tesla kan fan sälja Simpsonbilen utan problem. Hans nya pickuplegobil a la 80-talet har nått 146k ordrar på typ 24h. Bara 17% beställde snikvarianten. Inga feta reklam poster bara... Tadaaaa look at this! Coolt...

At least it has detail

I don't care what the Media says about the windows breaking, or what it looks like, CyberTruck is a Bad Ass MFer. Great Innovative Tesla Job! Nikola Tesla would be proud.

yo lo vi! Súper chistoso! Menos mal que “Tesla” jajaja y world wide television

By the time Tesla rolls its first Cybertruck off the line, Ford will have sold over 2 million F-150s and likely 3 million by the time Tesla has filled its entire 150k order book. But yeah, Tesla’s market value vs Ford makes sense. $ TSLA $ TSLAQ

More importantly, how’d you hoop?

One of you needs to buy one and drive it on some crazy terrain. Blizzards, Storm Chasing, Flooded Creeks, Rock Craws. And get it all on video and cut some movies. That 220V outlet can help replace damaged tires and the pneumatic line ca help air up or down for traction

That's bloody impressive. Personally, I have never liked pickup trucks, and I never liked the visions painted by movies like Blade Runner, so I'm hardly going to like a cyberpunk pickup. But 146K pre-orders is something to clap a hat on and take it off again. Well done Tesla. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

A lot of people dislike the new Tesla Cybertruck. But stop for a moment and think about it. The truck is bulletproof. If you steal one, and as long as you stay inside the vehicle, no cops can touch you. That is like a cheat code in GTA. # teslatruck # gta

If I had money to burn I would buy the Tesla Truck sarcastically.

Lol, deflecting the fact that every manufacturer nowadays demos their futuristic cars with camera mirrors that they later replace. BMW does it at CES every year. I saw a Mercedes demo a little bit ago. And Tesla has always done it. Of all the points you made this ones the weakest

Nice

You're also kind of changing class of trucks. HD (3/4 & 1ton) trucks are, IMO, a different class than this. I believe this truck is trying to compete with 1/2 tons, and I think it does it extremely well.

Don’t worry, it will be years and years before u see it

$100 refundable deposit is nonsense. i wouldn’t read much into the numbers. Tesla should have put the deposit at $1K, at least to gauge real demand and configuration choice.

lol thousands have already pre-ordered, and you’ll be seeing this on a road near you when it gets released

I wanna see a Tesla cybertruck in person

And given Tesla's brand, I bet its looks will make it into a powerful statement.

I was thinking more about the humanitarian and disaster relief side of our service members, but yes, it would also do well in the butt-kicking department.

Can you give me a Cybertruck so I could drive straight to the moon @ elonmusk? I love this truck so much and the fact that it was inspired by Blade runner is just so crazy! But in the best way possible. Thanks for your enthusiastic projects. Y’all in @ Tesla are geniuses!

Amazing! Can I use as a background on my phone and computer?!

If Tesla can make 146000 of them

Yes, I know of at least one non-Tesla owner who ordered one. I’m a Tesla fan and owner but think it’s butt ugly, but I’m not their target audience either. The younger gen loves it and will buy it in droves.

There is no such thing as bad PR. The shattered window just made more eyeballs look at the truck and realize this is a bullet proof, self driving super truck with crappy windows. Easy fix.

Let's be honest though. Elon could have rolled out Fred Flinstone's car last night and 100k of the hardcore Tesla fans would have pre ordered it, very loyal fanbase. It's no reflection on whether it's good or bad but if Honda had announced this it wouldn't have 146k pre orders.

i think that tesla shit fake, elon musk too smart and tesla too big of a company to make a mistake like that.

I have seen multiple people post in public @ tesla forums that they"ordered" # Cybertruck while stating they plan on canceling but wanted to join in on the fun. They just want the dopamine rush of the confirmation email.

Love your work, Senator.

Please reconsider driving a truck. They're a much greater danger to others than a car, and less safe for you too. “A pedestrian is two to three times more likely to die when struck by a pickup truck or SUV than by a car" https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-news/1762/why-trucks-arent-as-safe-as-cars/ … https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/03/21/iihs-gm-toyota-pickup-truck-safety/3221070002/ …

Yea lets just forget the fact that he owns PayPal, Tesla spaceX and many more companies.. and also the fact that he spent over a million $ to plant over a million trees a few weeks back

The Tesla Truck is growing on me... Somebody slap me..!

you’re rich so chill lmao

you right



i am following you and hoping to be the random person who will got the tesla . From philippines <3

Ohhhhhhh, the # Cybertruck must be where @ Tesla put all the corners they cut off their labor standards

Ahh, goes between jack and chassis. Can’t you just use a yellow pages?

disagree. the $100 is zero cost protection against the threat of FSD price rises. its open in all tesla territories regardless of lead time. One order for the truck is 1/10th of a model 3 order in terms of chicken counting.

I swear the new Tesla Truck looks like the old Kobes pic.twitter.com/It5SaUyoBA

And there are so many traditional trucks for you! Literally most trucks fit that! The world is your oyster! I’ll take Tesla

LOL...a truck foe people who dont buy trucks. As for those that do...not so much.

Everyone “flexin” ordering the new Tesla truck but it ain’t coming out for 2 years and is only $100 to preorder

i think the tesla wedge is pretty. instead of tesla i think mazda should drop an rx7 rotary in there, finally acquiring the perfect drag coefficient, and also keep the tapedeck. i miss my stupid gold car

The more I look at the Tesla Cybertruck, the more I love it.

The disaster that has over 146k pre-orders in just a few days. Honda has sold millions of gas cars. Automobile pollution kills over 53 000 people per year in the US alone. How are they more moral then Tesla given this?

It definitely is I C O N I C

Might help to at least try and understand the products and mission. Like our technology, our needs and wants are rapidly changing. Tesla is in the thick of it. Tesla is actually leading much of it.

Just finished saturday hoops with 6 people and there were 7 confirmed @ tesla cybertruck orders. # notatypo # thefuture

Elon, perhaps you should consider tesla glass for front, roof only. Heaven forbid I'm stuck in the cab in an accident with a shatter-proof driver's window.

ITs CaLLeD EXosKeleTon

At this point in 2019 you could tell me the tesla truck is what the madolorian is gonna use to transport baby yoda and id believe you 100 percent

R1s kinda looks like a Jeep, tbh I think the Pick-up Design looks cleaner in the front but they're both cool designs. (In my Opinion better than the tesla Pick-up, its technology is stunning but the design, nah).

Os painéis solares são só pra alegrar ecochato, a estimativa da Tesla é de mais 15 milhas/dia com os painéis, isso se consegue com 2min de supercharger.

I pray for that Austin!

is the tesla cyberquad going to be for sale individually at some point?

Definitely. I am not saying that this truck is some perfect truck for all circumstances at all, but a lot/most of current contractors in pick ups could switch to something like this and have an arguably better truck for their setup.

Well yes! It is possible in VR and tesla uses 3D simulations to train the Neural Networks and then deploy them but because there are so many factors involved and it's hard to train models in simulations and deploy them in real-world, they do it one step at a time.

I still don’t know how I feel about Tesla Cybertruck.

It’s an Edgy sub brand no Tesla badges all Cyber which is cool and smart.

Eu tava jurando que essa carcaça do carro da Tesla era só um negócio temporário pra não mostrar o real ainda

Many other manufacturers!

Happy for your purchase btw! Did @ elonmusk confirmed that Starship in gonna be made out of different material?!

Can you believe in one day Tesla already received 146,000 Cybertruck pre-orders worth over $8 billion. The deposit is only $100 so I wonder what the % of conversion will be and the backlog, but impressive.... # UglyTruckhttps://electrek.co/2019/11/23/tesla-cybertruck-pre-orders/ …

Can we just have news on the atv please @ Tesla @ elonmusk

ㅤ ㅤwhy that new tesla look like my roblox car ㅤ

Doesn’t matter if Elon was high when he approved the design of this truck. Tesla received pre orders worth 8bn USD in 2 days. Marmite truck - hate it or love it https://youtu.be/J2U9Hmmpqhc

That’s awesome . Zero marketing , yet everyone has their eyes in Tesla. Why ? Because they are making the best cars humanity ever saw . # teslabestcarever

I have read this tweet, but as I just said- the design is really cool and different, it's not that expensive and it has insane stats. Casey has money and he is a fan of Tesla. Why won't he order it?

Tesla ATV

Yes. But the future (BEV) is bleak for OEMs - they can't match Tesla's specs and be profitable. Can't appeal to non-boomers

He got $14.6M in reservation money. That doesn’t even put a dent in the cost of operating Tesla. There’s an ulterior motive besides cash flowing Tesla’s operations.

So what do you all think of the new Tesla Truck? New company work trucks?

It's too hard for most companies to do this esp marketers. They don't structure or empower teams right or hire those at a level who can win organic streams daily. Elon crushes.

I think it's unique. Like, literally every truck from any brand looks the same. Chevys, toyotas, fords, everything are not unique in their trucks designs. However, the Tesla truck is something different. They get my respect for having the confidence to try something different.

I want a @ Tesla but I don’t want to pay for one. Sometimes life is funny like that. You work to buy things only to realize you in fact can’t buy anything. I’m not really sure where to head from here

Oh , I didn’t know . Everything’s good though?

In the Q2 2019, Earnings letter, Tesla wrote "order generation has shifted nearly entirely to non-reservation holders." This implies that no more than 200,000 (and likely less than 150,000) of the Model 3 order backlog actually ended up purchasing a car.

Fun Facts to consider after today's deposit pump: In the Q1 2018 $ TSLA Quarterly letter, Tesla claimed that it had Model 3 "net reservations" that "continued to exceed 450,000 at the end of Q1." As of the end of Sep 2019, Tesla has delivered a total of 356,084 Model 3s.

Tesla got great free advertising in almost all media outlets with articles; sometimes 2 or 3 articles. Not all good; but the cybertruck design was on all of them.

Exactly, how much easier is it not to build something like this.

After the cybertruck unveil. People are now questioning Tesla’s design and direction

The deposit is billed as fully refundable. A guy in my office (who already owns a Tesla), put down a deposit even though he probably isn’t the target market.

Listen as much as this takes me back to my Halo days, this thing is about as polygonal as PS1 Laura Croft's tit

Very true. What may look great as a prototype may not cover all the practicalities required of it in real world use. I’m just hoping it will fly and come with a hoverboard when released

I applaud @ elonmusk and @ Tesla for their American Truck. But as a strategic cynic I do think about what I would do if I really wanted to mess up the USA. Are smart minds thinking about how to harden operating systems against intrusion? As vehicle density increases, so does threat

Its not the $100 per order, its the money he has to raise off a fake order number soon here to keep the music going for # Tesla since they're still not financially viable as a company. https://twitter.com/TheSmokingTire/status/1198242656708464641?s=20 …

Yo de esto sé poco, pero Tesla no es de presentar algo y luego vender algo completamente diferente. Tampoco sé como afectarán las regulaciones europeas, pero quiero pensar que lo habrán tenido en cuenta.

I could totally use this today for the @ DoughLab

I absolutely love what you're doing, but what was the design idea of this vehicle exactly? Your largest competitors, GM and ford, both make excellent looking vehicles, but this truck is, well, not too appealing. Tesla makes the most gorgeous electric cars, what gives?

Everyone cares. The reviews on the design have been horrible!

Unfortunately this wasn't the one we built since they didn't want us taking pictures but none the less the one we put together was fucking crazy and even had giant Tesla coils and shit

I agree with the LOL on Tesla time, the only thing worse, I don't know if you've heard of a computer game development company called blizzard, but blizzard time is the worst thing in the world and it's far worse than Tesla time.

I think Hyundia beat Tesla to the design they wanted... it is harmonious to what Tesla vehicles looked. # Cybertruck is a off beat of the melody they had been playing. Would be a changing beat to all forthcomming Tesla vehicles? pic.twitter.com/IE3MPOynl2

I know and I agree. But, they did some out of the box there... as I wrote... and personally I think they have a lot more Important stuff to address than that and they cannot do everything at the same time! It is not a bad idea at all but, not know... they need to push so much!

Uh, @ Tesla CyberTruck would be the most searched vehicle today.

I like the new Tesla truck. Looks like all those futuristic movies we saw back in the day.

@ i1Tesla is the best, forget the rest !

no it doesn't Elon made this to please the inner geek in himself and plenty of people will like and buy it ... he said many times before launch that it was gonna assault the senses and that it wouldn't be for everyone ... he knows this and he doesn't care ...

yeah because it was the first thing a 3 year old could draw when the theme was 'car'

Point not taken. I measured same week launch of two products Ford Mustang E (17.11) and Tesla Cybertruck (21.11). Very specific, very relevant. You diluted it all by broadening the time interval and adding brand names separately. Again: that measured nothing.

Those reservations are easily revocable, if I recall correctly. If not, that's huge for Tesla and I can't wait to see these things driving around.

For the company is much better in this way, you can have higher margins and max return on the investment made to build the factories. This is why Tesla is adding new models at the same time while scaling the factories, or why has progressively added new countries.

Way better, because the initial drag coefficient is higher with the truck by itself. Meaning the difference in drag coefficient will be less between the truck and a trailer and a Model X and the same trailer.

Ok AOC. Like I mean it’s not that simple. I want an electric car because of the money saved on the gas. But if you look at a Tesla. Every single one of them looks 100x better than this. It’s grown on me but still. Even the semi looks better. I’m saying I expected more from them.

Alias the tv show totally called it on the satellite broadband Tesla is working on Sydney says "A small constellation of satellites in low orbit is cheaper to launch & maintain than a traditional satellite network, and if 1 satellite fails the entire system need not replaced"

Why is Tesla trying to make a truck? The technology might work but the market is wrong. Truck owners 1) often live far out of town 2) often own trucks for fashion/signalling as much as for utility 3) frequently use trucks to haul things/animals into or out of the country

Doesn’t work as a design, it still looks like a sketch. Premature. Mechanicals are probably excellent but is has to look more fully designed.

I have said it! Amazing features, and groundbreaking in many ways, but for a company that builds beautiful cars, it’s just plain ugly! Not the way to reach the masses. And the design is not growing on me as many in the Tesla community say it will...

Good luck buddy

Someone pitched to Elon that truck guys would never go for a sleek tesla-esque truck so he said ok make it boxy and there was no going back

First thing any analyst worthy of covering Tesla should have done is go and buy some Tesla products. Analysts all have opinions. Some of these opinions are based on factual evidence, most based on false premises or misinformation. Many analysts seem so silly to those in the know.

The more you look at the specs and features, and the more you think about the extremely low operating costs, the better it looks. ;)

bottom one looks way worse to me

I bet it will be atleast half based on what people,towing with a Model X have seen. The truck is going to be way worse than Model X.

I only got to make this video in an ordinary @ Tesla and not a # cybertruck, but still... if you’ve ever wondered what traffic jams, self-driving cars, the Fermi paradox and multiverses have in common, watch this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq9XMr3GDUw&feature=youtu.be …

I’m drunk as hell and I’m researching about the Tesla cybertruck

I was dead serious, Elon. I love the whole electric car thing, I mean really I do, but what assurances do we have that the Chinese or Russians or non-state actors can’t get into it’s operating system and create chaos should the need arise? Is @ Tesla security hardening these?

This means @ Tesla has made over $8b in the last 44 hours. $4.2b in tri motor $3b in dual motor $1b in single motor Insane. Also, Tesla basically has a $15million loan from all of the $100 deposits. Brilliant.

My husband used up all his brownie points by making me watch the Cyber Tesla reveal.

horrible

does wish have Tesla truck

I'd say minus 35% on highway. So 163 to 325 miles. Not bad.

Also, usually for corporate events, companies will partner will an event management company, because they don't have the expertise inhouse. Are you sure Tesla didn't hire an event management co?

I love the noise of my tyres giving me proper feedback on what and where of the driving experience. A V8 sounds nice for a while... Until you realise it's huge distraction from the real driving experience. And it really makes an enemy of your neighbours. & rubbish perf too!

Well.... than I am probably not most people. I am loving it. Just looks bad ass futuristic. No other company dares to make the leaps like Tesla does over and over again. If it would look like a standard pickup... it would be a standard pickup...

Ordered Tri, but if it really is gonna be a year after the dual, will probably change to dual to get it quicker

People are paying Tesla AND marketing the product through the reservation system. It’s truly remarkable how this works vs time gone by. Well done

Clearly these features would only be in the premium edition. Even could be an upcharge package to go ultra premium.

When it was first revealed it was a shock to the system. But I warmed to it after I saw it driving around.

I predicted this about a month ago. There was no real reason for Tesla to reduce the deposit on all its models from a refundable $2,500 to $100 nonrefundable other than a plan to fake deposits numbers. It only takes 15 million dollars to fake 150k deposits now. https://twitter.com/markbspiegel/status/1198353576361365504 …

Of course and they say they trying to price under 50 thousand or is this different from the Tesla pick up truck???

It's a cargo-car.

And what kind of monetary barriers barred people from making these reservations for it to be so low at a mere 25k?

Hey now. I am a nerdy science teacher and I don’t like the Tesla truck.

..se procuraría, con ello y como conjetura (Uds tienen mejores ideas), evitar que parte del voltaje a lo alto de la bobina se pierda y dimane esa energía eléctrica hacia las espiras finales del dispositivo Tesla. En lo que respecta a la tensión eléctrica de éstas espiras...

Then that is a problem too. If electric vehicles are driven a lot further than ICE’s, that decreases or eliminates any environmental benefits while increasing congestion and making roads less safe.

Features like AP lowers insurance costs because of increased safety. Reducing costs means lower income. Now incidents’ responsibility is at driver charge. With AP, it’ll be OEM charge. Insurance companies may needs stronger regulations. Regulators are not ready. Loop needs time

Mom texted me this morning to remind me to spend my money wisely, dad texted me this morning to tell me he ordered a Tesla truck. I think her text was a subtweet

You don't know what they knew. But at the very least the woman who phoned in knew the claim was false, whether she was working with them or not, and Tesla told police they knew he was armed.

Rich people culture is saying they're "buying a Tesla to cut down on their carbon footprint and help the environment" but then they go and end up buying multiple electric cars. manufacturing cars also burns an immense amounts fuel? Is that Tesla truck really worth it?

No

Instead of paying for advertising, pay for the development of an actually good product, or pass the savings down to the customer. Old manicures don't do that, they rather spend their money on manipulating you. That works until Tesla comes around!!

I think you’d do well to listen to your own advice. @ Rivian and Tesla seem to understand that the true competition is ICE. Others seem to think it’ll always be a niche segment that must duke it out in their own vacuum. 2020-21 should be an interesting shakeout...

Apparently it's coming out that Tesla tried to swat a whistleblower. The discourse around that is going to be exhausting.

I’d worry about the range when hauling a 5th wheel, even if you can hook one up.

I have a question is tesla actually making money or is this just some kind of social experiment

14/ I've given Tesla benefit of the doubt for several figures in this analysis. We already know the KWH per mile efficiency isn't as good as what they claim publicly given customer feedback and posts. I used Tesla's own number for that.

13/ So basically, like everything Tesla puts out there, it's a gimmick intended to make things look cool, but doesn't pass any engineering back of the envelope review or thinking. We already know this Truck will not see the light of day (pun intended)

10/ Some cells in a block will receive sunlight, others don't. So some generate voltage, others won't, creating voltage on cells which causes them to heat up (diodes used to help). It's one of the things Tesla was looking at in its solar installations, some of which caught fire.

This is my favorite Tesla Truck meme. https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/OYlMrsC

3/ The average output power at peak sunlight is 15W from several sources I saw. So 1143W is the output power at full peak sun. Tesla Model 3 SR+ uses about 0.25KWH per mile (public figure, actual likely worse). However, Model 3 SR+ is at 3,627lbs, https://www.solarpowerrocks.com/solar-basics/how-much-electricity-does-a-solar-panel-produce/ …

Except the Cybertruck wasn't designed by a Boomer

I would be honored to work for your team in any way I can. I would also love to help in anyway make shatterproof windows that are more cost effective in the short run for the market and have some ideas for that.

musk's family stole an emerald mine in apartheid south africa. his wealth is not self-made. he is not a genius. he is a fraud huckster who takes credit for other's work and makes money from idiots. if was a fan of musk for any length of time i would be so ashamed of myself

4. We are long Tesla becuase its managers choose to invest early and often in innovative assets. If they got it right, it will be a long run of returns *leveraged* by those (and future) fixed assets.

For the cybertruck, you could potentially have a layer of x-aerogel, a transparent solar panel, and a layer of aerogel on top (or a particularly transparent x-aerogel), it could greatly improve the overall appeal and functionality of the cybertruck.

it's not that ridiculous if you remember that Tesla's automatically break if you let go of the gas. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to find a way to get rid of stuff entirely, as they are still going for the whole robotaxi thing by end of 2020.

Big question - can Tesla sell ~150K annually? If it is, I concede my case. However, i think its the geeks & Tesla fans ordering these vehicles. What happens after?

Ignorance is bliss, I guess. There are plenty of valid things to go after Musk for if that's your goal. Go pick on his shitty stance on unions. Try to pressure him into giving Tesla workers an ownership stake. Making baseless attacks only makes you appear irrational and petty.

I think Elon Musk intended for the window on the Tesla Cybertruck to break during the demonstration. It has since gone viral and there’s hardly a person in the world with a phone who doesn’t know about it.

Tesla had quite a challenge to achieve: to be the same weight as a F-150, *while* bearing a (very) large battery pack, and yet *significantly outperforming* it in all metrics. The braced cantilever/structural skin design is what allows this.

that is by far the most ugliest "car" I have seen. The other Tesla models are nice looking and fun to drive

Yo, did you watch them drop that same ball on a tesla glass panel from like at least 12 feet and it didnt do a damn thing. The trucks not scheduled for release until late 2021, the more likely scenario is that the glass panel in the truck wasn't the final panel.

Some say just kidding to this tesla truck please

I would literally go out of my way to get this truck just because of the looks

He said Cyberpunk and Blade Runner inspired. So what are people complaining about?

It has people talking, doesn't it? That's pure Tesla marketing.

Would love to order the SUV version on that platform. Or even better, the minivan version. Or any 3 row version. $40K minivan from Tesla would sell so many!

Don’t care what anyone says about @ Tesla ‘s Cybertruck. Shit’s cool as fuck!! • 0-60mph in 2.9 secs • 500+ mile range • 14,000lbs of towing capabilities • Futuristic Retro Vibez

Cameras. You won't need mirrors if the truck is driving itself. You still dont get it because you think full self driving won't be here by then. It most assuredly will be.

Lol conspiracy theory here . But look Tesla will do what it says not always on time but it does do it .

. I propose that if Tesla were to add it and x-aerogel that to its repertoire of R&D they could use it, improve it to have mostly transparent but flexible and shatterproof windshield that could be a good insulator.

Drove a Tesla and a Rolls Royce last night lol who do I think I am?

Hey @ elonmusk build an electric @ Tesla # vespa and I’ll buy one.

Be curious to hear about how pedestrian safety was thought out with the hardened steel exoskeleton? Trucks are notoriously bad at this, if Tesla could advance this aspect too...

My toxic trait is that I’d fuck the Tesla truck

No need for a cybertruck, I ride an electric 2 wheels and I leave in NYC. But Tesla is definitely a PR machine, even when with broken glass.

I see it as a total fuck up. Life long Tesla fan and early investor. I have understood every stunt, biz model, decision in the past. This one though seems like total hubris. The shittiest unveil in history, those people who depend on pickups will never buy this shit.

You can flip the Tesla truck order.

Please settle a debate, what do you think of the Tesla Cybertruck for $50k?

Are pretty good even now;-) they can take 5 hits with a metal ball until they break ;-)

So Tesla, in less than 3 days, was able to achieve 16% of that. In preorders. That means that the Cybertruck is already the 6th best selling truck in the US, for 2019, just behind de GMC Sierra.

Tesla has 146k orders of their Cybertruck. Meaning that they just raised $14,600,000.

tbh its like nothing ive seen before when it first rolled on stage my first thought was “that cant be street legal”

The visuals for Tesla's cyber truck looks cheap and crass. Apple would have sold that thing to the point where you'd be estimating your kidney's worth in exchange. Didn't do a solid promo video, no high def photograph of the car anywhere on the internet. They didn't try abeg

He and Tesla have just been exposed for having attempted SWATTING of a whistleblower who found safety issues while working at Tesla. So how much does he care?

Mercedes Actros trucks now use cameras and digital displays rather than mirrors, I'm sure Tesla will manage

But just because it’s difficult to do, does not mean it should not be done. If more people produce it, competition breeds innovation of methods of production.

Yeah but unfortunately i cant see myself driving it. Im not used to being the center of attention on the road lol

Tesla sells the best crash rated vehicles on the planet. Depends a lot on what’s behind the skin. Sure this will crash test well.

Ironically, this kind of nonsense (there’s a lot of it) undermines a company that is capable of that magic thing: showing people what they want before they know they want it. Tesla has massive hits & makes vast mistakes. Not recognising the latter does a disservice to the former.

Not a big truck guy but the Tesla truck has been on my mind. It’s ugly but it’ll do the job.

A tesla in every model pls and thanks

Now to tie this up: aerogel is actually very expensive Twitterverse, despite its many applications, because it’s difficult to make, and so few people do it.

Do you think Tesla will ever come to Nigeria? I think even if it did, the roads are just too bad for it. Imagine getting stranded on a highway that gets robbed and there are probably no superchargers, because bandits used them as a source of electricity to power their town.

See.... "146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri & 17% single motor"

Its awful

Same here. First look was, WTF! But by the end of the presentation I was hmm. Going back in the morning and looking at all the video I started saying out loud, THIS THING IS AWESOME!!!

Well technically not true. The stealth design has been around for years. Introduced for luxury by Cadillac. So boxy isnt new. New for Tesla maybe. There cars are hideous without this design.

I think there is room in the truck market for the cybertruck. I'm glad it exist.pic.twitter.com/56VY6gxrTX

We are all tired of the same cars, the same concepts, looking at them all look the same, only @ Tesla has broken the molds. Go @ elonmusk !!https://twitter.com/mayemusk/status/1198350049849180161 …

So again Tesla and the glass thing. If you ever tried to break a car window you know how tough the thing is and how *bouncy*. Had the window survived, the ball would have bounced right back and towards the audience. This just doesn’t add up. They must have known this.

Why do I really like the new Tesla Truck?!

Glad I met you too. Really enjoyed the event!

Tesla kaufen ist mehr Kult als "personal transport". Die werden gekauft von Leuten die gar keinen auto hatten, weil die den nicht brauchten. Jetzt fahren die gerne rum wegen virtue sig. Dieses Truck kauf auch keiner für Arbeit und wird vom Anwälten und hedge fund Leiter bestellt

Why would you ever buy such a car when you live in a city? This is a utility truck. We got rednecks driving F150s and rams in city's already. Why'd anyone want cyber rednecks, in bulletproof trucks that are made from space grade steel alloy that can be as fast as a Porsche 911?

That new Tesla truck looking mighty ugly I must say.



You forgot the tiny part: SolarCity,PayPal,SpaceX,Tesla Motors,OpenAI,The Boring Company. His father was south african so he wasnt a foreign company guy getting external resources.

apparently the performance is supposedly incredible for that price, i just wish we had more car companies trying to sell us electric cars by now so that tesla could troll in peace

In mother Tesla, you get delivered to Cybertruck

You mean, they’ll sell every Cybertruck they make as fast as they make them. If Tesla builds a whole new Giga factory just to produce 400k Cybertrucks a year my guess is that they could keep that going for 5-6 years - until something even more awesome is unveiled.

In terms of driving excitement... Hire a track car if/when you have to. But drive a proper EV for any length of time and you realise the old excitement isn't really excitement... Its just noise and complexity and inaccuracy. Well... That's what happe s to many (most?) people.

Still trying to figure out how a roof rack is going to work lol.hope noone needs to carry a ladder

With a so ugly design, I’m not surprised that Tesla’s engineers thought to protect that thing from any objects people can launch... Even Musk can not control himself !!!

Range Rover's have 'ClearSlight' rear view mirrors. They also have a similar thing for seeing where the wheels are at. Involves dark magic I believehttps://www.landrover.com/vehicles/new-range-rover-evoque/galleries/videos/overview-clearsight-rear-view-mirror-film.html …

you seem fun at parties

Im trying...i really am....but its just not happening so far.....

But claims were denied because a switch never took place. Just the encouragement to get a slightly more expensive model with better specs to get it sooner. Tesla still delivered for those who refused.

When will you be putting out your vid?

Elon Musk could have given us the 6000 SUX but instead we got the Tesla Cybertruck.

Same

Well... It's got nowhere to go but up I guess

I’m not a truck person, but the Jeep Gladiator actually *looks* like a proper pick-up truck to me. The Tesla CyberTruck looks like a cross between a DeLorean DMC-12 and a Chevy El Camino, and doesn’t speak “truck” to me.

Stimmt sonnst wäre es ja auch nur ein langweiliger Pickup mit den bekannten Rundungen :) ich würde mich sogar trauen den selbst zu Folieren :)

Same. I was on the fence at first, but now I kinda like it. A lot.

Nonono, it’s 2021 and that’s what you’re passing everyone in. Gotta look at the bigger picture man

Uds tienen consigo las mejores ideas, formas y conocimientos académicos que pueden llevar a la resolución técnica del desafío. Una sugerencia, tal vez excluyente, atiene a las espiras finales del bobinado secundario en las bobinas tipo Tesla, donde suele generarse las emisiones..

i think the tesla truck looks like a minecraft prius

Yeah. That design reduces the cost of manufacturing: no paint shop, no stamping. Any large square footage facility would do to build the thing.

I'm right there with you! # CyberTruck is awesome!

Same for me. Better and better

You don’t have to please all the people all the time. Trucks (F150s) are actually the top selling vehicle in the US. Tesla has successfully staked out positions in key markets (luxury sedans, regular sedans) so this is a natural market to go after and a small % is huge revenue.

where's the Tesla logo?

. And this passion drove my other courses in Math and Physics to be A’s and B’s throughout the overwhelming majority of my courses, despite constantly working multiple jobs, and led me to do something my friends often tease me about: reading physics and math textbooks for fun.

Alright I’ll do some digging. You do some digging and find out why they used an infants drawing to design this “truck” we can reconvene in a couple hours.

The windows might not be A1 but I'm still jackin' that new @ Tesla truck..

Between the Cybertruck disaster and more proof that Tesla is just objectively evil, it's a good day to sell Hondas.

That's Cyber-Awesome!!!

O'Really? OoooHooo Wooo! How good is it? And How designed and look and scores about it? Like 1-10, etc. Also that seems nice to add that Tesla Cybertruck I saw it on youtube, and made by Elon Musk!

Hey Tim I uploaded a video on why the Cyber truck is made for Mars. Do you mind giving it a watch.https://youtu.be/AulvN9Pz2aw

@ elonmusk how many retweets for a the new Tesla truck ?

Probably they are just monitors inside.

Both incredible. Atv made for the Cybertruck!

@ Sofiaan @ elonmusk Do I get my truck sooner if I work for @ Tesla ?

same. will need adjustments for passive safety tho

I keep going back and forth. I get it, I really do. I just don't know...

So that adds up to $5.9 BILLION in new revenue!!! # Tesla # Cybertruck # TSLA # CYBRTRK

Still its a strong "indication" of Truck's market potential. Frankly the ONLY risk factor is Tesla's new battery tech - which is crucial to trucks awesome range at low price point. Cybertruck design will really grow on people.

Call me crazy, but the Tesla Cybertruck looks more like something that is ultimately destined for use as a rover on Mars than anything else. Especially given the materials, the self sustaining aspects of it. And I'm down for that. # OccupyMars # Tesla @ elonmusk

Good thing you’re not in any associated with @ Tesla considering there were no mirrors or bumpers on the concept, it’s safe to say, it was a concept. Hopefully they take the feedback and tweak some things.

That Mr Musk, is an awesome result in such a short span of time. I personally didn’t like the design initially, but it’s started to grow on me. Perhaps out of my price range right now, maybe in the near future # ElonMusk @ elonmusk @ Tesla

Remember your Tesla terminology. A net new order is a confirmed one which is going to be shipped to a customer or sales location. A Reservation is a refundable customer ticket to eventually make an order. You have reservations. Refundable. And game-able by investors.

Today, I saw the first white @ Tesla Model 3 in real life.. It is so beatiful

Could you compare it with the other Tesla vehicles in like an ultimate show off and invite me to it?

Bon par contre Musk et Tesla semblent avoir pris un coup. Ils s'en remettront

Thank you. However, I am not a fan of the box design. Vehicles with the box look aren't aerodynamic. And the electric used to charge causes greenhouse emissions. Besides, Tesla wanted to supply freely. The cost of this truck is not free...

They should hire you to test their windows by slamming the car door in the face of a lucky stranger

I’m deadass copping a @ Tesla cybertruck at launch

The demand for tri-motor is mind blowing. Tells competition that 500 mile truck is in large demand.

That’s actually hella cheap for a damn Tesla

First electric pick up, also the ugliest.

Lol no. He has no idea how stressful Bitcoin margin trading can be. He doesn't wake up every hour to see if his company hasn't been liquidated because Tesla got banned by China!

OMG..I’m one of those ! Let’s do this! @ Tesla https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

And they did that by pricing it extremely attractively, equipping it beyond any other truck in the price range, giving it plenty of range, and by having the best software in any car by a country mile. Tesla is on a roll. Heaven help the car industry if they ever start advertising

(actually they would have called it the most durable/rugged Tesla ever, since every iPhone is "the best iPhone we've ever made")

The Tesla truck is sick I’m gonna buy one

That @ tesla cyber truck looks like a Alien vs Predator car that didn’t make the cut

@ elonmusk I wish those of us with little/no/bad credit had a way to get a Tesla when we have no co-signers and are completely on our own.

De seguro tiene un hermano como homero Simpson

看到 Tesla 發表的 Cybertruck，好像去哪裡都行很堅固，但還是要去充電站充電吧？想像一下開去荒野，中途還要繞到有充電站的地方，很荒謬啊。我的妄想是能不能設計太陽能板在車頂，一邊開車一邊充電

I've liked what Tesla's done so far. But I honestly have no idea what to make of the Cybertruck. It'll be interesting to actually see one on the road, and read/watch reviews. But my instincts are ringing the 'flop' bells, harcore. We'll see. But I think it's TOO different.

A $100 pre-order ticket that’s refundable should not be counted as an ‘order’. Misleading, but still impressive to get that many people to give Tesla a $100 loan. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

146,000 orders is like $8 billion in sales for Tesla’s Cybertruck since its debut with no advertising or paid endorsements. Sheesh, not to mention I just seen they have a referral program. Elon is a genius!

Ok, I saw it on a Facebook post. Someone had posted the Dream bed that You can put in it and I thought it was ironic that you can make a Tesla “space” for someone for 30k but affordable housing is $600/sq ft

That’s what happens with every new Tesla release afaik

The GND is anything a person wants it to be. It saves the world, saves humans and animals alike, gives people money each month (whether they want to work or not), gets rid of all debt, ends racism, creates 400M jobs, cancels neoliberalism, and gives everyone a Tesla. All that.

Some stupid people out there. This vehicle will never be built. What has just happened is Tesla raising $14.6 million in 48hrs. Those $100 deposits are easy to spend.

The Tesla truck is the chunky fila of the road

I kinda like it

Tesla Cybertruck RWD: 24,820 reservations (worth ~1$ billion) Tesla Cybertruck Dual Motor AWD: 59,860 reservations (worth ~3$ billion) Tesla Cybertruck Tri Motor AWD: 61,320 reservations (worth ~4.3$ billion)

The Audi e-tron SUV, also starting at 74k, I would say less features and capablity for near 2x the price. But at least it doesn't look like a prop reject from Robocop. https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-e-tron?csref=t1_paid-social_twitter_etron_national_x_display_Interest_traffic_2019_etron_x_x_x_2019-11-11 …

These are more reservations than any other EV has had in the last months from any company. Media/WSt can laugh as much as they want but when something has the economics that Tesla’s have consumers will make a point.

If I had boys and live in the US, I would literally force my husband to buy the Tesla Cybertruck. Since I have/am none of those so...I'll just admire it from across the world. This feature definitely appeals. (i mean one can disappear in the wilds and rough it safely). pic.twitter.com/RpVEgIdGx2

Oh, really? --> Elon Musk says Tesla has received 146,000 orders for its Cybertruck https://cnb.cx/2pOA2qi



Serious question, with the steel exoskeleton, how will Tesla have crumple zones for crashes? That is how a big part of how Tesla has maintained the worlds best safety ratings. Will the truck have these zones for absorbing impact, or??? Thx

You forgot square root

Comes with a solar roof, ATV, power outlets, air compressor — and bio filtration mode. All set for whatever the world throws at you.

Don’t worry. Your product (once delivered) will be making YouTube even more wealthy and have all the free exposure a company needs. Like I’ve said, @ Tesla could make a dildo & have all these youtubers lining up to screw themselves for them likes & smash of the sub button.

I don’t think the Tesla truck will steal much away from the Ford Raptor at all....its a completely different buying group. It won’t steal any business from the large Diesel trucks either...they will laugh at the Cybertruck.

Power providers, but in another way

A stainless steel body sounds great! Compared to the competitors, that exoskeleton has a better lifespan. Use planned product obsolescence, against your competitors. Allow the option to upgrade your vehicle, as it ages. I would use it as a selling point.

Tesla skal nok eksistere mange år frem i tiden. Ift. Cybertruck har jeg stadig ikke bestemt mig for om den er tudegrim eller tæskelækker. Men jeg er vild med at de tænker nyt - hver gang!

@ Tesla Being a EE and survivor of a fatality wreck; getting out is just as important. Please design or talk about means of egress when the battery is compromised and the doors/windows can't be opened. Even smoke can kill in a sealed compartment, let alone fire or water.

That's $8.2 billion of potential revenue. This is the answer to all under-informed idiots who criticize @ Tesla and @ elonmusk .

I’d still pick two cars - electric for getting from a to b and petrol for just pure driving excitement. (If I could afford of course). Perhaps soon electric will grab the excitement factor too. Once batteries are less heavy perhaps? Or... hydrogen fuel cell perhaps?

The future is bright, green, and renewable. # CleanEnergyWillWin

you're very cynical why would the failure benefit Tesla inc? also, anyone who actually needs and uses a pickup would find it near useless. how is it going to carry or tow anything?

Congrats !!! I’m a Tesla fan and shareholder and next year an owner. This truck I’m still processing, but I have my eyes on a model 3.

I'm wholeheartedly in agreement. It's so fucking ugly that it's never going to sell beyond the rabid Tesla fanboys who've been champing at the bit for a Tesla Truck.

I agree. Looks new and fresh and still tesla ish. Cybertruck next to a model s, 3, x, and y will look like when Honda made a civic ish looking EV with stupid ass covered wheels, lame style, and didn't look like any car that had style. Shouting do not buy EV truck. But It has fans

The English courts would eventually throw out the case and the subsequent 3 appeals Tesla filed. The estimated loss in sales was estimated 180k in sales. Which some simple math will indicate is less than two Roadsters worth of monetary value.

El nuevo coche de tesla es una puta basura, en cuanto a diseño y materiales, y me está dando mucho puto asco los fans lamiendole las pelotas a Musk y Tesla por una puta mierda, simplemente porque es electrico y es un Tesla!!11!!1!!!!1

Tesla would eventually try to sue BBC (Top Gear) for defamation and monetary loss in sales because of it. Saying the car didn't die from flat batteries, or the engine overheating or brake failure, like Clarkson said.

When Tesla released the Tesla roadster, one Jeremy Clarkson wrote a stern but fair review of the new convertible for an episode of Top Gear. The $100k car died after about 55 miles of testing, after being told the cars battery life would last for 200.

No, he bought it from two individuals, then proceeded to buy out their right to be called founders. They are legally obligated to never refer to themselves as founders of Tesla because Elon wanted to own that right.

Tesla doesn’t want to make things too complicated for production. That’s why they chose something easy to produce.

Thanks for your feedback! You know what I think is Alex Jones territory? Elon Musks's promises.http://ElonMusk.Today

Time to preorder that Tesla truck

Tesla stock fell 6% they say, so they used that for their claims of net worth loss.

The only thing live about the Tesla is “bulletproof”

You know that unwritten rule where you don’t talk shit about a mates partner, dog or car? That seems to not apply when Tesla is involved (not happened to me. Just observing)

i desperately need a @ Tesla Cybertruck in my life.

I think Mikey likes it. Even if everyone bought the base model, that would still be over $5.8B.… And no one has even driven the thing yet. Not too shabby. Way to go, @ Tesla Team! https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

No. GF3 is a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture. Cell assembly is the Panasonic side. Pack assembly is the Tesla side. The chemistry was joint developed and the IP shared. Tesla is currently in the process of eliminating Panasonic from their production chain (Maxwell, HiBar, etc)

Unpopular opinion but I think the Tesla Truck is ugly as fuck and a whole bunch of people only love it because it's made by Daddy Elon. An electric truck is great. But that thing, in my opinion, is an abomination. Downvote away.

Tesla announced that it made a profit of $143 million during the third quarter of 2019. So if this is true, I believe him.

The specs on that Tesla truck are wild

You are proving my point. Tesla is going to sell Cybertruck to people like you.... meanwhile most truck buyers will be laughing at people driving the Cybertruck.

@ elonmusk have you thought about making a Tesla trailer? Contains extra batteries for extended range and regenerative brakes too.

@ elonmusk the ATV looked really cool. Tesla is trying to help reduce pollution etc. what about an affordable e-moped due to increasing services such as Deliveroo etc.

Loved the tantrum declared by @ Teslarati *Tesla’s Cybertruck will set the trend for future pickup designs, LIKE IT OR NOT* that means *it certainly will* bending hesitating minds of masses is a subtle art

For putting on a concept car presentation that won't arrive for 2 years, Tesla got $15 million, in cash, today. What the fuck am I doing trading shitcoins all day long. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

Innovation and big car companies just don’t mix. They work on a decade (ish) level development cycle. Modern car (and for that banks etc) are totally ‘agile’ in their thinking and can respond/react to change. Exciting times for these. Now if only I could afford one

It would also make great PR for Tesla to have its own Truck as the official standard of new terrain exploration in space colonization.

The evolution goes even deeper. Like integration with your calendar. And like learning your transport habits. Just getting started on the use cases. Those are some user stories I would think make very very interesting writing.

Do yourself and your marriage a favour. Cancel the deal!

Tesla meant to break the windows, I bet. These folks meant to get people talking. It’s earned media. Now, will that have an impact? Does blocking a road really help social justice? That all depends and their is a time and place for everything but it was definitely something.

The people I've seen buying the new Tesla trucks are rich people who have probably only ridden in a truck and have no use for one and have only bought it to flex

Thanks for getting me the new Tesla, Jerian.*

Definitely.

The beliefs of many Tesla fans are indistinguishable from religion.

He is literally saying Tesla will pay him to make videos.

Yes Oragami who knows maybe someday the vehicle body can morph into other shapes for added protection or use.

yes, and if you add it, pls try new windows glasses would be nicer

Whenever I see something that is so obviously a bad idea -- Guaranteed Rate Field, the Tesla truck, biscuits and gravy flavored Pringles, this new Fire design -- I wonder if it went through any kind of focus group testing.

Just showed the Tesla truck to my fourth grader. She responded with, “It’s origami.” @ Tesla @ elonmusk

Isn’t that why he started the broing company? To dig holes for public transport (although I think it was originally for Tesla’s, then they pivoted to public transport) in places its currently not possible to do at similar prices.

Watching this, I do wonder if they can keep water out when it pours rain outside, or in a car wash @ elonmusk @ tesla? Please tell us that you will look into this

I was totally excited for a Tesla truck...but that design is hideously ugly - beyond even consideration. That truck could space travel and I’m still out.

Dans toute entreprise, il y a un maillon faible, chez Tesla y a quelqu’un au R&D qui doit avoir perdu son job.

That’s awesome! I’m cutting this out as we tweaks!

Specs and Tesla beat a okayish launch! Awaiting # CYBRTRK @ elonmusk

The # TeslaCyberTruck is stupid looking but it will sell well because it’s affordable and people want to say they have the Tesla truck

Too bad it looks so horrible

THAT’s where I’ve seen the Tesla # Cybertruck before...on Saturday mornings back in the daypic.twitter.com/DPA50exkh1

is it impressive that almost 150k people have put money down for the cybertruck? yes. but remember, its only $100 to deposit, and its refundable. Tesla had almost 500k reservations for the Model 3 with $1k deposits, how many of those are sold?

Because they are cheap mass produced shit that people buy because they have no other options

Just goes to prove the old saying people in Tesla’s shouldn’t throw stones.

mano o elon musk é tão genial que fez o novo carro da tesla daquele jeito pra poder virar meme e ter propaganda grátis

I love the effort, truly, but it’s ugly...butt ugly. A number of renders were far better looking than this...ummm...thing.

Hahahaha, some of the blogs thought 200k the first day based on the order numbers. So did Tesla intentionally start the order numbers at 80 or 100k to make it look like there were more of them?

So while a lot of people hate it, I enthusiastically love the Tesla CyberTruck. I already confirmed a reservation for the dual motor! I love it's dumb aggressive door stopper aesthetic. If you're not on vibe with cyberpunk you're free to drop outta channel, you won't be missed

For example: there are now transparent solar panels, but there are trade offs for their performance. My suggestion is to use a design like the cybertruck eventually on Mars as a Mars Rover (I have full faith in SpaceX’s mission and Tesla’s drive to get us to be better stewards of

That's where Tesla falls short. Not marketing is a bad thing. I wrote you a 20+ page missive on things to address to help the company. I wish you had read it.

This Tesla cyber truck or whatever it’s called. Surely an absolute load of waffle, can’t believe we will ever see one, not that I want to looking at the thing?!

I'm a Tesla fan and don't like it. But specs and price tho. Hopefully there will be more cyberpunk products by Tesla but also a more sexy elegant Tesla truck with that slick look we're all used to. Did you notice it doesn't say Tesla anywhere on the cybertruck?

You got a point there. But all the Tesla vehicles are man made and us as people are not perfect. If i had a Tesla I would not utilize the self driving mode. It's scary to me to put that much trust into a machine/computer. I seen people sleep in them it's crazy

If you don’t have a need for it then don’t buy it, the environmental impact from buying a new car is massive.

If this product is embraced by US pickup culture, it’ll be really interesting to see what that does for @ Tesla politically. I think there’s an overlap with anti-electric/anti-Tesla sentiment Republicans and the US pickup market. But if they all start driving cybertrucks, well...

Ooops......Better than three quarters of a billion dollars wiped off Musk's fortune in an instant........ This has to be the butt-ugliest vehicle ever produced. The Tesla Truck makes the Pontiac Aztec look good, scratch good, maybe just a little better. http://news.sky.com/story/elon-musks-fortune-hit-after-tesla-cybertruck-launch-fiasco-11867808 …

Imagine believing that any Tesla is a luxury car or is anything close to perfect... they arent. But, they are pushing the envelope for a future with marketable, electric, FAST cars better than anyone else.

In the future, somebody will start a company called Musk, like Elon started a company after Tesla.

Tesla already received 146,000 Cybertruck pre-orders worth over $8 billion https://electrek.co/2019/11/23/tesla-cybertruck-pre-orders/ … by @ fredericlambert

Is Tesla perfect? No. Is Elon a good person? Debatable, but on the whole, I don't think so. But there are real people behind what Tesla is doing and I think that we should be applauding the work they've done in making green tech viable within this highly unjust capitalist system.

See? That's what I'm sayin'

I need to understand what ICE (intrusion countermeasures electronics—see Gibson’s “Burning Chrone”) it has. The commie hordes presumably may take control of Tesla and at least parts of the Internet. What stops Tesla from rounding up owners or driving them into walls?

More than the science is the process. What throws me about Tesla is they run it like a software company, not an automotive one. But there are things you can get away with in software that you can't in the auto industry, where people die if things don't work.

Which makes money to next TESLA ?

I'm not saying anybody is wrong if they like that new Tesla car thing, since design tastes are very personal. I will say that, to me, it looks like a 7-year-old drew a dollar store knock off Delorian and then handed it off to an alien to build.

Brancher la maison à la batterie de la voiture et l'utiliser comme une powerwall de chez Tesla ?

Anyway a tesla logo could be added to the front of the cybertruck?

I'm thinking it was very important for them to lock in orders at any price, expect the final msrp to go up not down, might be a $100 well spent

Keep striving and innovating, we will do the advertising for you. We’re all glad to be a part of the Tesla community. Thank you!

Man, you are so right. Tesla represents the convergence of technology and transportation. Using tech method to bring product to market. Auto makers traditionally uses Henry Fords method circa 1919. This allows Tesla to respond to consumer demand not sell an ice re-tred! # Tesla

Breaking of the Tesla Cybertruck was intentional. Free marketing. Now they have over 160k reservations.

AFAICS only @ Tesla can fix this glaring hole with a firmware update, which I genuinely hope they do.

Ahhhh. That’s good then. Not being a Tesla owner I’m not privy to the wonders of @ Tesla One day perhaps. Still not a huge fan of the single big screen inside; I like buttons and switches (as well as screens) as they are consistent and (imho) offer better HCI

Hammering the door may have effected the frame as well as structure of the glass. “It didn’t shattered” ... true. Tesla is going into defense business. This truck looks like futuristic defense vehicle.

People are petty, opinions are thing to tell the difference between personal preferences not a reason to unfollow someone

One of my favorite things about Tesla.

Some People has to much Money.

Take a left turn and everyone else will follow! Conformity for who?

Time to buy the shares. This Company has revolutionised the car industry and is selling loads of cars as the old industry just looks on. Cos who have been around 100 years making cars can’t match them. A blip for Tesla.

As a Tesla stock owner, I'm thrilled. As a person with eyes, the new Cybertruck is a cross between Back To The Future's time traveling DeLorean, and a dump truck. Maybe with a bit of Army tank thrown in for pizazz.

That'll void your warranty. You can use your Nissan Leaf to power your home right out of the box, but Tesla does not allow it.

Burning cash is unavoidable when massively scaling. Also, profitable last Q and expected to be next. Also also, 15 M is peanuts at this point. Also also also, booked as liability until converted to sale.

Goodness! Looks like a cheap prop from a post-apocalyptic movie!

For whatever it’s worth, the F150 is the number one selling car in America for 35 years, much of the truck market is set by Ford.

Exactly right, cars are designed to crush to absorb energy in a collision, but remember , Tesla vehicle’s are designed to avoid a crash in the first place

Just when it seemed like things couldn't get worse for Tesla after the botched unveiling of its Cybertruck, the internet weighed in. https://wtvr.com/2019/11/22/teslas-cybertruck-has-become-the-butt-of-every-internet-joke/?taid=5dd99f5a9007110001d2f34e&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter …

Tesla, turning into Raytheon

Friend of mine reckons he'd trash it after 6 months with his (admittedly extreme) towing habits. Do you need real-life heavy duty test pilots? His dealership refuses to service his current vehicle until he removes all the kit he carries around!! I think he needs a Cybertruck.

the thing that Tesla people and Disney people have in common is that both groups need to be sent to re-education camps

La Renault Zoé est une citadine. Elle est taillée pour la ville, et peu faire de l’autoroute et des grandes distances (moyennant recharge évidement) occasionnellement. Ce n’est ni une Kia, ni une Tesla. Il suffit de regarder les prix d’achats et la qualité (bien qu’en évolution).

Well, still you can reap the benefits now

Same was said when Tesla said they would build a mass market car. Too difficult, leave that to the pros. Did not age well...

I think the US pickup culture doesn’t have a ton of love for the Tesla brand, or electric vehicles. But they definitely value performance and impressive specs. My guess is that the specs and the price point will drive adoption with this segment.

Thanks! $15 in 3M 1080 vinyl.

Y’all stay drooling over Tesla’s like that man doesn’t use your tax money to build@his products and then STILL LOSE MONEY SOMEHOW

It's Galaxy Brain fer sure but I think people will come around on it. Sure it looks like it's straight out of Blade Runner but as usual... that's what Tesla said they were going to do and that's what they delivered.

Hi @ elonmusk, what is the Drag coefficient [cx] of Tesla Cybertruck? It's shape doesn't look very aerodynamic, but maybe you did some magic...

We can't let GM/Ford EVs to lead. They will stall & do only so much for transition because of legacy factories. Only TESLA can keep these companies honest.

Out of 16yrs of being in biz.. Tesla has book a total of 4 Qs of profit which equals to 1 yr.. out of those 4- 2 Qs were profit due to selling ZEV credits and some form of fancy accounting.

I mean as much as I hate the concept of a billionaire Elon is using his influence in a pretty unique way. Sure he’s defo built up a bit of a crazy ego recently but his companies are doing good id argue. Tesla reignited the EV market after GM killed the dream in the 90s

Tesla’s Cybertruck looks weird, but so did Apple’s AirPods https://tnw.to/ypcM3 - via thenextweb

It’s unfortunate and I feel like us Tesla fanboys are blinded, but people have been talking down on Tesla as of lately. Online, people I know in and out of work, and family . I mean they aren’t completely turned down, but they’re definitely questioning.

Absolutely not!

The Tesla truck will replace the Mercedes G Wagon as the official big vehicle for the rich, mark my words.

So since I sold the X5 I've been driving my work vehicle, Lexus hybrid. Not sexy, gets the job done, no payments. While I wait on the @ Tesla # Cybertruck should I just keep riding the Lex, buy something sick to compliment it, or replace it with a Model 3?

CNBC is always writing negative things about Tesla. It’s weird. Someone at CNBC must have shorted it or something, who knows.

It's a bloody awful looking vehicle..... Maybe in a post nuclear apocalyptic World....

Talking to the six people I know who pre-ordered, it’s an exact mix of both. 50-50.

Tesla’s Cybertruck is available for preorder with a $100 deposit https://trib.al/VxH5wei

Way off the mark. I’m a big supporter of electric vehicles, but this thing is a hideous misstep.

It’s why Elon Musk built the supercharger network all over the US. That singlehandedly makes the Tesla a product that people can use. The Tesla goes from a cool curiosity nobody would actually buy to a useful practical product people do. Just because of the supercharger network.

@ Tesla petty/stupid question: will it be available in black?

How do you even get the ATV? Do you have to buy Cybertruck to get it?

I think it's designed after 'bring your kids to work' day

dont see why the tesla truck would need a brake if youre a good driver all you need to do is keep accelerating forever

@ MKBHD

That’s some wild shit but defenitly something expected. Every other car in the bay is Tesla it seems lol

Was just thinking that while riding a local streetcar—which is transport of the future, unlike anything Tesla would ever make.

Be honestly ... that’s true... This maybe lots ppl’s first pick up

Understood. Everyone's situation is different, and Tesla is already in a pretty comfy place. My larger point was more about the individualism and constraints that lead people to take risks with big, bold work—without having to care about a market's existing expectations.

Well, it certainly looks like a handaxe ...

Hello Elon. This is literally worth nothing to you, but I wanted to say that although it may grow on me, I massively dislike the look of the truck. 0 design cues from any other Tesla model. Maybe the lack of any design makes its design unique....??

Buyers who likes Tesla should like the last tech and not use old fashioned check. It'd be a contradiction.

It's not ugly. It's just different than what you're used to. It will be the norm in 5-10 years

@ elonmusk @ Tesla @ Erdayastronaut I think the metal glass on # Cybertruck is for windows and helmets on Mars. Last thing you want is cracked glass on a planet where it can't be replaced

Seguro que el próximo cae en la sede de Tesla o en la casa de Elon Musk... https://twitter.com/abc_es/status/1198345475402932230 …

the tesla truck is so ugly and i saw someone say that & somebody else said “why cause it’s a design you’re not used to” no bitch cause it’s ugly lmfao

They have 3 full production vehicles on the road doing just fine along with the most talented engineers in the world and lines of top tier college grads lining up to work there but they wouldn’t think to put side mirrors on when they need to? Lol

Today I drove a @ Tesla and I fell in love with it so I am asking for donations my cash app is below $parkerrayy

What do the windshield wipers look like @ Tesla @ elonmusk

@ Tesla @ elonmusk @ spotted_model @ tesla_addicted curious how many Cybertruck purchasers were prior Tesla owners. And how many will pop their Tesla cherry with the Cybertruck???? pic.twitter.com/Ka6bsNqbKJ

Mat. That word was mat in my head.

was that tesla in the new dw trailer??????

The Tesla truck has to be the ugliest shit I’ve ever seen

It's not the most attractive thing I've seen. But I assure you, if I could afford one, I would certainly have one. The comfort, function, safety, performance, price, all outweigh the importance of how it looks. One day, it will be mine.

That’s because on real truck the door would absorb the impact protecting the occupants where as the Tesla would transfer that force through to the passengers

The Italian tesla looking dope

In 1.5 days Tesla generates $14.6M of non-fundable money on the promise of a truck that won’t start deliveries for 3 more years. I can’t wait to start building my tri-motor. My wife already hates me for it!

Epic. However, it looks as if it would hurt a lot to get hit by that pointy truck

Here's an idea, if you don't like Tesla why the hell you wasting yours and everyone's time. Go find something you like and get a life

We love you Tesla!

If this was in all black it would be even more boss-like and impressive!

Fuck a Tesla truck get this beast @ LittleMissFURYpic.twitter.com/fROQmdG8px

Next up Tesla electric scooter

Cybertruck = 80 mile range when towing that trailer

Well I like it. It’s so Tesla. It looks at the way the automotive industry designs cars today and runs in a complete different direction. Nobody at Ford or GM has the balls to pull something like this of. For this fact alone: love it.

I personally know more people who have pre-ordered the Cybertruck than any previous Tesla vehicle. The price is right on the dual motor spec.

Congrats Viv! I suspect you’ll get plenty of # Tesla referrals, as you deserve, even before you take delivery. Amazing!

you bet if those Tuber dollars start coming in, I'd be doing the same. It's just so perfect. Besides, you know, the low polygon count :P

@ elonmusk: No go ahead and design the truck. I trust your design ideas. I'll see you at the unveiling. Just giv'r.pic.twitter.com/jTujDWMMrD

DO IT!

Awesome! Visionary design!

Like it or loathe it, those are some pretty impressive numbers. # cybertruck # tesla # EVhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

Yet when the came to America he started with nothing, he and his brother slept in their office and showed in a gym while they built Tesla, he has indeed earned his, and it's wrong to blame him for his families actions before him.

Tesla succeeds in electrifying cars - planet livable - tesla wins Tesla fails at electrifying cars - in the grim darkness of the future, people live in pressurized cars because they can't breathe the outside air - Tesla wins Literally can't go tits up!

Steering wheel is. Slowly losing the shape of a full wheel and eventually disappearing completely! @ elonmusk @ tesla # tesla # autopilotpic.twitter.com/2l8SgdGcgq

Interesting maybe even useful to consider how large-scale "phototropic" parking & travel would change water tables. By definition large sunny areas would then be in shadow of parked vehicles.

Esa pick-up Tesla... por más que la miro con ganas de que me guste no lo logro

Whatever the number is, I hope you’re part of the don’t. Also, as a former marketing research professional, your poll sucks.

So, Tesla already sold a minimum of $ USD 5 billion in Cybertruck...

You could "borrow" the Tesla truck design. Just saying.

Can you buy me the Tesla Truck?

I don’t think you could use a gooseneck connection like this because of the sloping sides on the bed.

Yeah, got one.

146000!!! # cybertrucks pre ordered. i'm in there @ elonmusk wow!! that's about 3X what i had imagined for $ TSLA @ Tesla https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280 …

Hey @ elonmusk I know it must be difficult to capture the automobile industry in India so why not dominate it by introducing Tesla 2 wheeler instead of cars as the masses use 2 wheelers more than the car....Just a simple thought. K bye.

Tesla’s Cybertruck looks weird, but so did Apple’s AirPods https://tnw.to/ypcM3

My Tesla truck would smoke you in a drag race

Well this *IS* Elon Musk were talking about here... The guy who smoked a huge blunt on Joe Rogan's show in violation of his DoD contract, and who also tried to have an employee whistleblower SWATed for exposing the manufacturing and product safety violations going on at Tesla.

Like if you brought @ elonmusk @ Tesla # cybertruck

Really spells out the difference. @ Ford should be scared shitless along with the entire full-size ICE pickup truck industry. # tesla # Cybertruckhttps://twitter.com/cleantechnica/status/1198058764940775425 …

damn I want the tesla

Lmao u realise Tesla ain't the only ones with electric latches lol my 2019 A6 has them all around including the avant boot hatch and that's just one lol every semi premium car from a passat to an S class to McLaren senna have electric hatches so why do people only talk bout tesla

Have you a dream car collection? I do and it's pretty dope Tela Model 3 (P), Tesla Model S 100D, Tesla Model X 100D, Tesla roadster 2020, Ferrari 430 Scuderia ( My real dream car), and two more Ferraris! # getitdone # Ferrari # teslatruck # Tesla

Oh... take in consideration that two years ago Tesla did the same for a $250k sports car. Now this truck for $70k seems like a DEAL for the segment that can’t afford the roadster. Who te fuck is the genius behind this? I want to hug you

that would eat Tesla's entire margins. it's not like retail clothes and shoes that has 50-100% margins over Chinese production costs.

the tesla truck is indestructible so the bourgeoise can hide when it’s time to eat the rich

I'm not fond of its appearance. He should have demonstrated incorporation of Tesla advanced designs in a some what more conventional looking truck. It would've attracted more interest from the usual truck buyer.

I’m enamored by the geometric design of the # Cybertruck! They definitely share similar design language.

Interesting. Asked Baillie Giffords James Anderson at @ MoneyWeek event yesterday if he would buy # tesla now if didn’t own. Still a firm yes.

@ elonmusk @ Tesla my Friend told me that it is impossible to get a reply from you let alone some merch .. Can you prove him wrong? :0

@ elonmusk I love the Cyber Truck, but is it possible to put ladder racks on it? @ Tesla

You have to wonder if the Tesla’s were driven twice as much as the ICE vehicles? But then given Tesla’s claimed safety features, they should have come out better than even.

People are hating on the new Tesla truck. If it wasn’t for people going beyond the normal and designing for the future we won’t have innovation. Congrats to @ elonmusk for innovating.

I don’t understand the concept of this truck, I thought it would be a little rounder, everything is too straight whit no curves. I just love curves on everything. This is the only Tesla car I don’t like.

@ elonmusk This whole new tesla situation reminds me of the sonic movie. They teased us by showing the worst and most disturbing sonic anyone has ever made, but by listening to feedback it was changed. Teslas new car is that same sonic. It needs improvement, but can be amazing.

Hey mr. Musk. This is Alireza and i am so interested in designing cars and i have done some works related to face lifting the tesla model S. I would like to show you them.

The Cybertruck is the first Tesla product where you are price competitive at purchase even without having to consider TCO over [x] years. For the Model S, 3, X and Y, you could argue that the ICE alternatives are cheaper to purchase. Not so for the Cybertruck.

@ elonmusk can the @ Tesla # Cybertuck float? If it can, then with a built in power outlet on the interior of the bed, it could be easily converted into a real electric boat :) thoughts?

não acredito que o vidro do carro da tesla simplesmente quebrou k k

I wonder what it was for model 3, too. Surely they must be using that as a model to figure out production scale

It does look like a little kids first drawing of a pickup truck

Please don’t lie to kids.

Let's see some 4x4 action!

It’s acc pre cheap starting at 39000, cheap for Tesla

Unibody design # NotATruck

That's the thing, what is the final product gonna look like, if your gonna reveal a vehicle then you need to reveal final product, ie no signals, no mirrors headlights that form to us regulations etc.

There’s more poetry in beauty than that

Last time I checked,Tesla made profits in the last quater,which is admirable because they build up mass production starting at zero 4y ago and are now pumping out 5000 Vehicles a week. Even GM will take a while to introduce a slightly changed iterated model and get it profitable.

He also has a lifetime of experience in wiring machine-tools and control systems to get a production line working smoothly; something Tesla has struggled with. He was laid off in 2009. Tesla Motors could have had his uniquely-suited skillset aiding them. But Elon passed on it

My father was an electric engineer for Ford Motor Co. He came up with a concept similar to a Tesla; using a variable-frequency, variable-torque electric motor to power each wheel - but used a normal engine as a generator for it, skipping the battery problem entirely.

I agree, I had the same reaction, until I watched @ DougDeMuro's video on it. He made some excellent points about the Mustang being Ford's flagship model.

https://youtu.be/AulvN9Pz2aw

It’s not a pickup though



Tesla was dead, Space X was almost dead and look where they are now, they were a bad investment yet he didn't care because he doesn't care about the money but about the objetives of the projects. Go to mars, cure neurological diseases, help global warming, safer AI..

http://Tesla.gs for sale.

Not convinced Ford's will be better because they aren't following a ground-up approach with F-150 electric. With efficiency as important as it is in EVs, every design/engineering trick needs to be leveraged. That's why Mach-E is as good as it is.

He's not a saint and sure he is a billionare, but while others would get a huge Tesla salary he doesn't and while he could be sleeping while others work for him, he doesn't, he is there with the engineers developing new tech, tech that could save lives (Neuralink)

Disagree. The @ Rivian electric pickup is for more trend setting, and gorgeous, then the Cybertruck as well as being more practical. Also it's high towing capacity is something that I don't believe Tesla will be able to touch.

Open/close? No shit

Likewise!

Well then, don't drive the Tesla truck on Wall Street. Take Water Street instead. It's all wet, anyways.

Tesla is doing what Apple did with the headphone jack. They made a truck so insanely “futuristic” that people are skeptical. Yet before we know it, everyone will copy this design. https://twitter.com/earth/status/1197906989973684225 …

Well one thing the new Tesla pickup does, it makes the Pontiac Aztek a little less ugly.

it would have been so easy for Tesla to truckerize their basic Tesla sedan design and show off the torque by having it pull something heavy, instead they went with the "what Autobots turned into when they lived on Cybertron"

I am.

Если у вас будет выбор не организовывайте мероприятия в Москве в Tesla 4000, там охрана отвратительные быдляцкие мудаки, которые сначала 40 минут выпускают людей до гардероба, а потом выгоняет всех на улицу ждать такси

It’s not a concept car it’s going into production with everything required to be legal. You really think they don’t know what’s legal and what’s not?

Truck design for sure. Not what the industry expected. Stock is bought & traded from pro and cons Tesla ppl. Stock is honestly doing fine even with the "hit". Just over a month ago, it was in the mid $200's.

i’ve heard several people talking about how tesla’s new truck got its windows got smashed during the reveal... Elon is a marketing genius

It's so ugly! How, when the other Tesla Model cars are visually stunning?

If that’s true, Musk is certainly a viral marketing genius. However, the stunt has backfired as the public’s perception of Musk and Tesla have been damaged.

The Tesla S can be purchased with a range of 600km, so I think that it's easily possible that the Tesla Truck can be built to do 600 - 800km. The Tesla S of 2013 onwards is not the S of 2012. In 2017 the S had the highest owner approval of all cars. The Truck will get better.

It's a nicer design than this for sure, but they never should have used the Mustang brand on it. Because it's absolutely nothing like a Mustang, not even in specs.

Should CNN’s video “Tesla’s ‘unbreakable’ window demo goes horribly wrong” be the first video to see on YouTube for # Cybertruck or a debate on vision for future and advancements in engineering? It must be hard to see it objectively when concerned about view counts. @ elonmusk

Yes I suspect it is priced so low because he knows he won’t sell many and will make a loss on each sale. It’s a marketing gimmick to raise awareness about Tesla IMO

You see a lot of # tesla decorated garages on Twitter & YouTube. I wanted the # stainlesssteel @ Tesla logo to be visible from the street. It makes people walking by curious about the brand and the cars. Many ask questions. And I am happy to answer some of them.

I agree that for most of my needs, a Tesla would more than suffice. I'm even intrigued by the Cyber Truck. But at the extremes the battery falls short. The range is almost there but the charging time remains too long and heavy loads push that even farther back.

I don’t trust anyone that says the Tesla truck wack

Yes it is. It's ghastly. I'm not going to say anything about Tesla's truck, but there's one universal truth about pickups in general: They are ugly. Deliberately ugly. The fact that their target audience actually likes them this way does not change the fact that they're ugly.

The thing that got me is the expensive one with 14,000 lbs towing capacity and 500 mile range. Those two things are mutually exclusive I bet. Wonder if you can tow that much for 50 miles with the Tesla. Also stopping that much weight, better have some good brakes.

it was plainly never meant to be an actual, usable _truck_. something that was useful day to day. my guess is that the # Teslatruck is intended to be driven very infrequently. as little as possible, in fact, and preferably to some form of safe hiding place.

Tesla’s cybertruck looks absolutely fucking stupid and I’m already sick of seeing the memes about it

@ DavidDobrik which member of the squad is going to get Tesla’s Cybertruck?

This is awesome. We need to go to fully electric vehicles. We got Tesla cars and cybertruck.

Then why announce it as a production vehicle if it's not? Say it's a concept and this all goes away. Also, you can not see the rear lights from the side, will have to be changed. Also also, would love to see the pedestrian safety ratings. It can NOT look like this.

You don't need a truck. Hold out for the roadster.

The part where Tesla calls the cops to report that Tripp was armed and a possible threat, when neither thing was true is swatting regardless of where Tripp was at the time. If you assume that Tesla was acting in good faith then the unnamed woman did the swatting through them.

Sure, there will be a lot of initial orders abandoned. A good number of Model 3 pre-orders were abandoned. But then they were replaced with even more and they basically sell as many as they can make now. I think it's too early to say this is a success or not, basically.

Agree. It is not winner take all, and in 10 years, every major automaker will have great EVs. Rising tide lifts all boats and Tesla will be one of the winners. The traditional ICE companies will be fighting to survive, and some will not make the transition.

Hardly. Fleet vehicles make up 33% of Ford sales. And this crushes the F-150 for fleet business purchases and government procurement. Then when Tesla RoboTaxi fleet kills UBER & Lyft and Tesla loads it with low cost Cyber Cars and Trucks...game over

It's 1.4301 brushed stainless steel (2 mm / 0.0797 inch thick). I got it from a lasercut service after sending them a .dxf I made from a vector logo. I guess they didn't even know what it was Dimensions are 500 x 500 mm / 20 x 20 inch. It cost me about 90 €.

That's your face after driving the tesla cybertruck

Assume the truck will be 1,000 lbs heavier than Model 3, and obviously a much higher CoD. # Cybertruck requires a much larger battery, higher battery cost offset by lower body and glass cost. Amazing job @ woodhaus2 @ elonmusk @ Tesla for 20% ($10k) below the previous target price

At just $100 for a pre-order, I’d be shocked if they weren’t good. But pre-orders ≠ sales. They’re a meaningless metric that tells us nothing more than how big an interest-free loan Elon is getting.

I've always been a cyperpunk fan and been admiring the designs of cars on net. Now there's Cybertruck. I'm in love with it

Everyone is giving their opinion about Cybertruck so here we go. I'm a Tesla fanboy but I hate it okay thank you goodbye

tesla made a car that looks like the graphics from the 80’s tomb raider games

I haven't heard much about Tesla motors trying to hire up a bunch of ex-big-three automaker guys, which is confusing to me. A lot of them were laid off, and I bet a lot of them would love to consult even part-time to share their expertise. Tesla doesn't have a Detroit office...

the only thing i can think of when i see the tesla cybertruck is black mirror

Todos se burlan del pick up de Tesla y es el mejor pick up del mundo

@ elonmusk @ tesla you can announce anytime now that so many people want the truck you're moving up production to next year

or.. just think how much more innovative Ford would be if they put all that marketing resource into design. @ Tesla buyers don’t buy b/c of nice presentations, the products does a fine job.

So I live in the UK, and we have a fair amount of Teslas, I've even seen Superchargers over here. But according to some, Tesla are vapourware and use the cash to just bail themselves out and don't build any cars

Kinda fuck with the Tesla truck

@ elonmusk @ Tesla I want to have a garage with all electric cars, only # Tesla the rest ev aren't the same

If I get the Tesla Truck, get camo paint, put 30’s on it, and put “Master Chief” on the side, pls just mind your business while I live out my childhood dreams

That’s an irrational concept.

Tell him to use the pistons of the suspension as accumulation tanks for the compressor. If not that thing is not to to be able to be used at work sites. The compressor needs a bladder. If not it will suffer and likely break.

@ Tesla @ elonmusk "Full-Self Driving" vs. "Full Self-Driving" on order page.

Did you hear about the replacement parts that come with a goddamned NDA you have to sign? My biggest objection to Tesla motors is that Elon thinks he can do better than the established automakers at *every element* of car design, a great deal of which is outside of the engine.

Guys I heard there’s a way to create a chemical reaction on the steel to cause it to look this way without easily being scratched. Is that true?

@ Tesla # Cybertruck metal glass windows didn’t just break for fun, the machine broke the internet in the last 24hrs. Good job @ elonmusk.

So the motors and gearbox and suspension must be as durable as the skin and glass. Tesla has had numerous air suspension durability issues, suspension component breakage, and more. None of this is abnormal for avg cars. But for this concept its gotta be better. Lots better.

Anyone that is super critical of the @ Tesla cyberteuck window breaking has never really sold anything. When you sell, you realize that It’s the demo gods at work!

that truck’s beyond beastly! now we need @ elonmusk to create a tesla plane and shake up the industry completely

I bet I can, I would bet 90% of Norwegians could have an informed debate v 5 % of Americans. Here’s simple question...for an average a person-what would make more economic sense to buy new-A Toyota Camry or Tesla Model 3 base version? Now list 10 non economic reasons + 3 moral

There are still peeps out, that don't know Tesla If you don't need a pickup or don't want, there is no need for knowing Rivian

@ elonmusk @ Tesla Thoughts on Oregon Trail being added to the arcade? I want to die of dysentery but in a different vehicle.

It’s a lower cost of ownership than a Ford F150, or are Ford 150s for rich people? Tesla Model 3 has a lower cost of ownership than a base model Toyota Camry, or are Camry’s just for rich people too? Also, how do you square your cover photo and being anti-Tesla?

Looks good, but it destroyed all the rear cab & bed straight line mechanics features. There is more to it then the sliding bed cover stuff, I imagine. I think we will have a year or so of refinement of the design, but the "odd" lines might hold more potential the we give credit.

They don't need to convert every truck buyer. No truck does, hence a number of OEMs in the segment. As noted in other tweet I wrote, pre-order numbers are looking pretty good.

We've seen Tesla use memory chips that wear out too fast. Screens that suffered from known color banding due to heat/thermal cycling. Massively quick rear tire wear from regen. Phantom power drain. I love the "ultra rugged, indestructible" vehicle concept. But it needs to be 100%

Man, first the Tesla truck and now this, I’m reconsidering my follows....

So when I saw the @ Tesla # Cybertruck for the first time, it wasn't just a new, feature-packed, affordable truck with a radical new design that differs from anything on the market today. No, it was much more. 7/

Watching @ Tesla - and @ SpaceX - grow, struggle, and thrive over the years has fueled this hope that out there, somewhere, somebody is turning their dreams of a better world into their reality. And I'm pretty # stoked and # grateful I get to be a a part of that reality right now. 6/

i respect yours too i’ll steal i tesla for you

Enter the original @ Tesla # Roadster, and then the # ModelS, and then the # ModelX, and then the # Model3. All of these vehicles, in their own right, making waves, challenging the status quo, and demonstrating what # innovation truly looks like. 5/

To be fair, any EV charged using electricity from any clean source (renewables/nuclear) will be pretty clean. My problem with Tesla is they're overpowered toys. Admittedly if you need to do >90 miles a day and there's no train, there might not be a better option. A bit niche tho

@ Tesla # Cybertruck is not just a product; it's an awakening. It's a glimpse of our future in the stars made manifest here, today. I've said it before and I'll say it again, thank you @ elonmusk, @ woodhaus2, # Tesla for being so bold, helping usher humanity into an amazing future.1/ https://twitter.com/martindouglasj7/status/1109513260720545794 …

It's pretty clear. Think for yourself and stop buying into the lies surrounding "Elon Musk," SpaceX and Tesla.

What Cybertruck does do is throw down metrics Detroit needs to hit with their electric truck offerings. Which, if they rise to the challenge, means more accessible cleaner trucks for everyone. Win.

Electric Pickup trucks are a non-existent market. Tesla won’t get a big share of that soon to be growing market with a niche product.

Tesla's armored cyber truck is designed for the beneficiaries of economic disparity as a line of defense against its victims in particular.

Unless that ICE is burning something other than fossil fuels e.g. Hydrogen. Of course this all depends on the original power source. A hydrogen burning ICE using solar generated H2 will be cleaner than a Tesla charged from a coal plant.

What would be a meaningful solution then? Should we all convert to electric cars? Sure let's do that. But wait that can't be done so easy cause most people aren't fucking rich and able to go out and cop a new Tesla asap. Please tell me how citizens are the problem not corps.

You mean still facing haha

What y’all think of the Tesla CyberTruck?

I’d buy the new Tesla truck if it ran in gasoline.

I have to wonder if these people actually ever leave their house. I can't walk ten feet in Austin without bumping into a Model 3. I get that Elon/Tesla hype stuff. But how many gigafactories, filled orders, financial statements, etc. do we need to stop thinking it's all a scam?

Lmao just watched the Tesla truck failed demo

After seeing more videos of this Tesla truck, I’m more intrigued.

calling it now the Tesla truck gonna be very important in the hip hop community

jajajajaaba

Buy the truck and put monster truck tires on it and call it the Tesla dirtster

Price to Stats wise Cyber Truck wins no contest but you will have to wait an extra year for it as it’s Second Half 2021. Mach-E and Model Y are next year. Mach-E is cheaper than Y due to $7500 tax credit which Tesla no long will get. Model 3 beats Mach-E but in different class.

And you don’t think retail customers will do the same? People in general go with what’s familiar, and pickup truck buyers not only like the familiar, but want the image that comes with the truck’s association with work.

If you look just it long enough, the Tesla CyberTruck is pretty special

A Tesla model 3 + a powerwall or a Sonnen Battery would be the route to go. Consider they will have to install the battery + an EMS (energy management system) that’s basically the brain and security heart of the system

I dont actually disagree (I drive a Tesla) but it's that fervent dead certainty and refusal to even consider what someone else does could actually be as good or better that's fanboy behaviour BTW nothing wrong with being a fan of something, I'm not having a go at you

I like Tesla, SpaceX and @ elonmusk. I believe in him in most cases. But # Cybertruck is not looking good. It doesn't fit in Tesla lineup and look. Hell, it doesn't fit on any line up :) Ugly AF. it could be nice to have in a zombie apocalyptic game, but that's about it :)

Tesla stock will go up on next days open This is my prediction

No matter what outcome of general election, Tesla will not comeback to UK. It will be a lost about 2000 jobs and few % of GDP.

Everyone who buys the Tesla truck should leave their laptop on the front seat since the windows are unbreakable. *video not found*

Quite thankful for the Tesla story yesterday. Nice to see everyone complain about something other than HNIC.

just realized that the 4 tesla models all spell S 3 X Y. how sexy of you @ elonmusk

Tesla with that lazy ass car design calling it innovative

the new tesla truck looks like the car the bad guys drive in the futuristic ya novel adaption where a 16 year old girl with special abilities must overthrow the government

Tesla dropped that Cypertruck to prepare us for the End of the world. Stainless steel bulletproof. That’s an apocalypse vehicle if I ever seen one.

I can't wait for mine!

I’m fairly certain this is in reference to ad space investment, not sponsorship opportunities for youtubers, from Tesla.

It just doesn't look like a truck that's into "sharing."

Casey, I think you're an amazing film maker, you have re-invented media. You're a fascinating personality. But you just summed up in one tweet what is wrong with America. At some point our population is going to have to realize buying things based purely on "want" is wrong.

That's the thing about stainless steel, you can wrap it easily. People are going be so creative customizing this thing! Tesla is going to print money faster than they can roll steel with no paint shop or stamping equipment needed.

Explain why it’s cool for every other automaker to make crazy looking futuristic concept cars for the auto shows but as soon as Tesla unveils a futuristic truck, we hear tons of negativity!

Probably not a prank. It is bold but it is an exoskeletal design and it is easy to manufacture with machines alone. Also other brands are making electric trucks this will just kick it into higher gear like the first Tesla car did

Jokes about the cyber truck aside, Tesla needs to either stop putting Elon on stage or getting him some executive coaching lessons ASAP. The guy is a smashed window of a public speaker.

True!

Do I have to buy a whole Tesla just so I can get breakable glass for our special effects team?

the new Tesla trucks make me think of those killer robot dogs from black mirror

"Someone". That is Franz their chief designer and constant black clothes wearer. Also, someone is the proper name cor anyone working at Tesla with a surname not Musk.

Very true and I keep telling people this. But to be fair, not everyone is on Twitter/social media or keeps up with Elon or Tesla. Overall, it did hurt the Tesla branding, but not the EV movement.

I just showed my brother a comparison photo of the Newest Ford F150 and the cybertruck, who really hated the cybertruck. His first words were: Well that ford is really old model so... Which then closed the case for me. So yeah even sceptics change their views without knowing it.

The power wall only does one cycle per day if that. A grid system does multiple so the degradation is much faster. Tesla has the right tech for mobile storage like EV’s but the wrong tech for stationary grid storage. His work and progress is amazing! But VRFB will be Grid storage

It'll be interesting to see what happens after they actually begin delivery, there are around 150,000 preorders but at $100 many could cancel. I think Tesla will try and push the "function" part of this.

Basically, his whole thread is based on fleet volumes and there's truth to the basic premise. No doubt, most fleets will continue to buy what they're familiar with and companies do pay less for vehicles because of tax law. This doesn't mean disaster for Tesla.

This will at least be better than a loud, lifted pickup spewing diesel exhaust fumes. The Tesla isn’t made for city driving, but it will be quite and have active pedestrian detection and automatic breaking.

Tryna pull up in a Tesla with my feet up

The order page for # cybertruck clearly and specifically states that ordering locks in the FSD price.

This sums up a lot of my feelings about Tesla Motors in general. On one hand, the Tucker Torpedo debacle was a Thing. On the other, he IS trying to compete against an automotive industry that's been refining their science for many decades, and it shows. A lot. https://twitter.com/Merryweatherey/status/1198335038452043776 …

Who wanna buy me a tesla

I think a lot of it depends on FSD, how it holds up over time/miles, and what current ones sell for at that time.

They never claimed it was anything other than a modified Lotus (probably because there were still adults at the company back then) but this was presented as an ATV Tesla developed. Total lie.

Well, when you see it as a tool you understand it's there to be used and wear and tear is normal. I don't have emotional attachments to tools, and therefore work trucks. I'm willing to pay for quality as well.

All of this actually makes sense

This is exactly what I wanted when I saw the truck for the first time.

Tesla has shown that can build and mass produce EV’s. Cybertruck will be able to be mass produced. Elon actually has the battery making capacity to do this unlike other auto makers

as far as I know Nissan says you can pull energy from leaf model, although I believe it was a test(or publicity stunt related with CA blackouts), ironically Tesla roadster is the only Tesla with that feature

I believe pre-orders are much higher than what people are expecting! Looking for 300K - 400K units pre-ordered of Cybertruck. We need @ elonmusk @ Tesla to confirm pre-order numbers! $ TSLA # Tesla # Cybertruckhttps://twitter.com/vincent13031925/status/1198297785964978177 …

Hey Boogie, since you wanted a Tesla so bad, buy that new Tesla CyberTruck. Seems a lot cheaper than the one you originally wanted. You can pretend you're a real life Cyber Punk

@ elonmusk @ Tesla I love the Cyber truck. Had the site on refresh till it became available to preorder.

You have to wonder what Elon and his team are thinking but if your going to go down in flames go out in your own way. Tesla might’ve surrendered the majority of the electric pickup market to Rivian and Ford before a production model from any of them roles out.

No car company is dependable, try getting a replace part from Tesla

L’ultimo video di # DiMaio e # BeppeGrillo mi suscita le stesse emozioni della presentazione del SUV # Tesla.

But...when I saw it, I knew it was build for you. Its like...U build it.

Would you have put down a reservation for the Cybertruck if it was released by Rivian instead of @ Tesla with the exact same specs and design?

Moi.. what have you done... you’re making me want to draw a warthog and Tesla cybertruck

Friend of mine - drive train engineer, gave me this price points: 6-cyl ICE motor: ~1500$. Transmission ~1000. A electric drive train is as of now not cheaper. Rare-earth magnets, copper, inverter electronics, high voltage igbt's, etc. + batts , you see why Tesla makes no profit

I'm a Tesla fan *because* of their battery tech, and not the other way around. And VRFB continues to lose ground to li-ion in stationary storage, and will continue to do so regardless of how frustrated you are with this fact.

I’m not here to defend General Motors; they’ve had their share of problems and shitty cars. My point is that it’s flat wrong for Tesla to be a nonunion factory, especially in California. Any supporter of worker’s rights that has no problem with this situation is a hypocrite.

@ elonmusk My dad just bet me $20 that in two years @ Tesla will have less than 10% of electric car sales. Please don't cost me $20. He's trying to talk me out of a Tesla and opt for a big 3. Gross.

Was puzzled by Cybertruck (which I love) and why Tesla would Obsourne themselves that badly. But aha! Why not kneecap e-truck competitors (like Rivian and Ford) by putting out a too good to be true (price, range, perf) 5%-baked concept car? It’ll never ship.

So, Wolfgang Puck called out the Climate Change hypocrisy in Hollywood. They all think he's strange for not driving a Tesla - yet they all fly private planes everywhere. Twitter would not let me tweet the article!

Thank you for making my point for me. It's not out for over a year, you have no way of knowing if it will be the best truck available by then, you just assume it will be as you are a fan of Tesla. Swap the word badge for manufacturer and my point still stands.

i agree with this, but what is going to sell more the Tesla cybertruck that starts at 40K or a design from Tesla similar to Rivian which would have forced them to start it at around 70k. i'm not sure, but most likely the cybertruck regardless of how it looks sells more

Buying a Tesla and pre-ordering their products will have a greater effect than remembering to vote in 2020. Politicans don’t create real change. Consumers do.

Imagine this: Elon and friends had a stretched model 3 with a pickup bed nearly finished. Sort of a Tesla Ridgeline. Then that home built version hit YouTube and went viral and they had to go in a radically different direction in just a few months. # Cybertruckpic.twitter.com/3FEontfuFm

Conflict Diamond needs to be expanded to other resources because some a hole just bragged to me that he owns stock in Tesla and is happy about it's recent price increase, seemingly unaware of the recent Bolivian coup.

Rough guess Tesla expects to be making batteries at $60/ kWH. Price parity with ICE by end of 2021?

It just casts doubts as to how Tesla views engineering & testing. Do they perform rigorous testing in controlled environments before, or after they ship?

@ elonmusk I watched your truck unveil and looks awesome. Will add it probably to my Model X and 3 Tesla collection - one question. If the truck has such incredibly rigid body panels, how is it going to handle collisions with crumple zones, and be safe for occupants?

When is Tesla entering Indian market?

Yes, this is a standard tenet of unfettered shareholder capitalism. But there is something to be said for the longevity of Tesla's vehicles in particular; many real world owners with 300-400K miles on the odometer. That's a testament to their lifespan vs. ICE cars

Were their any tiedowns in the bed of the Cybertruck to secure cargo from sliding/shifting during transport, or in the future does Tesla expect everything to be held in place via their unannounced tractor beams?

Hahahahaha!!!! As an example of what not to make a truck look like. Really hope @ Tesla and @ elonmusk rethink the final design!

The new truck from Tesla looks like the cars they had in Total Recall (1990). If only they had the Johnny Cab drivers.

The truth is even those who didn't have enough to buy a truck in the beginning this price is a big opener for people to become truck owners

Especially with no electricity to charge it. Great idea

The one thing I like about Teslas, which I’d hoped another company that makes gas cars would adopt, is dog mode.

The apparent lack of energy absorption, because of the exoskeleton, in a crash is rather concerning. I'm not seeing where, as a utility vehicle, this design changes the transportation model as a multi-use platform. e.g Delivery, Snow Plow, Tow Truck etc

The cybertruck is probably already a boat and soon a sub and plane..

If Tesla Cybertruck looks similar to NASA’s Mars rover concept... well many other cars and trucks of this Earth, using big wheels, could be similar.

But will you get your act together and put some EV charging in your car parks ready for next season? Have a word with @ Tesla and they can help you make it lovely

The truck will be awesome to see coming up using summon to get you in the rain.

Tesla unveils first truck – here are the pictures of the 'Cybertruck' revealed by Elon Musk https://americanmilitarynews.com/2019/11/cybertruck-revealed-by-elon-musk/?utm_source=popsmoke&utm_campaign=alt&utm_medium=facebook …

I agree it’s a very large - great for the US but in many markets like NZ where I am - too large for most car parks. A more compact truck would be a good move in international markets.

Spot on - it's a concept. It certainly has people talking about Tesla cars, which was probably it's primary function. Damn, we're a bunch of curmudgeons...

I’m surprised there aren’t more Tesla Cybertruck memes.

@ Schwarzenegger , you getting one right? A Tesla CyberTruck?

Più o meno? Nel mio caso (faccio 40000km/anno) l'auto precedente mi è costata nel tempo più di 40k€ di gasolio. Ora ho una Tesla Model 3

Why am I annoyed that @ Tesla's # Cybertruck's weird looking design (in my opinion) is growing on me, Is this how it is supposed to happen @ elonmusk ?

the one about tesla, can't remember the name tho i love this series and want to play as much games as possible

It definitely is and many journalists have commented the same. Works great when stationary but it's worse than physical buttons/wheels while driving. BMW do it best at the moment since they have all the interactive methods (touchscreen, scroll wheel, voice control, gestures).

Since @ Tesla # Cybertruck's release I've already forgotten what Tesla's, and trucks for that matter, used to look like.

agreed, non static physical controls are a driving hazard until true driverless is available

Sure. I think the tri-motor has a 200kWh battery pack. My house uses about 1000kWh /month. # Cybertruck could use powerwall electronics to backfeed the house power. It could also use the motor controller to provide high amperage 220vac/60hz at 100’s of amps.

You can add Maserati boomerang & blade runner b2 bomber & all in to the mix. You shld be seeing few many of these on ur local roads by that time. If it follows m3 production hell schedule , I should get mine by Q4 2021. (It took 23 months for me to get by m3- aug 2016to july2018)

- The design is straight out of a video game. - The target market is young males. - The price is moderate and cost of operation is low. Seems like their might be some overlap.

I don't see much harm in this particular scenario. Even after this drop Tesla stock is still up 30% since tax day. His net worth would still be way up on the year. Plus his tax bill under Warren's plan would only be about half of what he cost himself by designing an ugly truck.

The new Tesla truck looks like what people in early 80’s movies thought trucks would look like in the future.

What does the cost of them manufacturing it have to do with anything? That’s not how much the consumer pays genius. You’re also basing an argument on if you only drive 10k a year or less? I brought up the truck because this is a post on the Tesla truck, try to keep up

Tesla stocks skyrocketed after Evo was ousted. It’s pretty fucking obvious. Evo set limits on mining Lithium, Tesla needs Lithium for powering their cars, Elon goes to his buddy Trump to ask him to put someone new in Bolivia, Trump does it, boom.

Sweet. Was nice to see you.

Right. As opposed to a Tesla that costs $80k and is comprised of rare earth minerals that make a nuclear reactor look safe. Feel free to return to the 10th century In your pursuit of higher prices and more “environmentally safe” goods

Are these VW prototypes (will make production) or concept cars (won't make production)

Out performs as a physical pkup truck? Is it a 4x4? How big is the cab? How many people can sit in it? The triangle shape does not appear doable as MOST people have CHILDREN. What about interior storage for groceries, etc? What is the seat to roof measurement for head safety?

I agree. It’s inspiring not because it’s a beautiful design (in current design thinking) but it challenges almost all current thinking in truck/car design - but for mostly functional reasons. Brilliant.

I thought the Tesla CyberTruck was nothing more than promo memes for Cyberpunk 2077, especially after the failed armoured glass window "demo". Why would anyone non ironically buy that?

Well, people have doubted Tesla since day one with every single model so this is nothing new. Betting against Elon has never worked out too well so time will tell!

2 motor AWD Tesla SUV launched at $50K. That means with 10% tax, NRs. 64,00,000. Base variant of Jeep Compass costs NRs. 68,50,000. You should launch it in Nepal asap @ Tesla # CyberTruck is https://youtu.be/m7atGkba-Z8

100k miles = 10 years @10k mi/yr Battery modules (it's not a single pack) cost Tesla $2,5k to manufacture today. 10 years from now they should be a small fraction as muchnew, even cheaper salvage. And I have no clue what you're talking about re: the truck.

وقعت شركة Tesla في مأزق أثناء إزاحتها الستار عن أحدث مركبة كهربائية صنعتها، بعد أن حطَّم كبير مصممي الشركة نوافذ المركبة خلال محاولة إثبات متانتها. ونتيجة لذلك، هبط سعر سهم الشركة بنسبة 6%، لتتراجع ثروة المالك الشخصية بمقدار 768 مليون دولار بيوم واحد. https://trib.al/biyXII9

Why the @ Tesla Cybertruck Looks So Weird https://flip.it/GPC1eR

The actual truck looks futuristic& awesome. I mean it’s a Tesla so that says volumes.

No I got the tri motor one for the longest miles and biggest towing capacity.

Dimensions wise it seems similar to a Model X (ok a bit longer) donut should.

Dirty Tesla Display?

i know for a fact i did not just see a LIME GREEN TESLA,,, i hate LA

Tesla truck looks like something I'd steal when I'm at 5 or 6 stars in GTA: San Andreas

Also one thing that was notably absent from the presentation: safety. I want the Cybertruck to be as safe as the other Tesla models (if not better). I know safety is a top priority at Tesla and we will possibly hear more about this as the launch date is closer.

Talk about how much diesel you have to burn to fuel the machines that pull the Lithium out of the earth to make the Tesla batteries. Then talk about how the car is still made from Iron and Aluminum. Lastly, mention that most electricity is still generated by burning coal.

People claim $ TSLA stock shot up after Morales was deposed. But they wouldn't care to know that the stock ACTUALLY shot up because the co. reported their record quarter financials. And if ANY EV mfr is going to have a transparent supply chain, it's Tesla; why not go after others?

This is so ugly. # Tesla has great cars but they really need to work on the aesthetics. At least the DeLorean was somewhat visually pleasing. This looks like a post apocalypse bucket of bolts & high school shop project.

The perfect triangle is there for a reason

If you are using the brake pedal on a Tesla you are driving it wrong. Between AutoPilot and regenerative braking it isn't needed.

Not true at all. They drove only drove it on blocked off private roads. Plus, have you seen any of VW's prototype cars lately?

Perfect for Costco shopping..

Disruptive on all levels , like the noisy kid in Gr 1 who could design a better truck with a crayon? Disruptive in this case doesn't make money, so far Tesla has been proving that year in and year out. This truck brings them one step closer to the end. No market, no demand.

It also has the most range of any Tesla I think, you can get up to 500 miles on it which is insane

This picture sums up perfectly why we as a society have to change the whole way we think about driving and using cars - and not just change the engine for electric/hydrogen.

I appreciate what Tesla has accomplished & understand Elon believes he is marketing like Steve Jobs on steroids. But IMHO the truck of mars is way off-brand for the marketplace. He will sell a lot of them but only by cannibalizing the market for Model 3’s. I hope I am wrong.

It looks low-poly and I actually love it

I’m sure they all drive Tesla’s..

This Tesla truck is a study in how the line between success and failure is weirdly narrow. Nobody would drive such a stupid looking vehicle.

I love every single thing about that truck if I close my eyes and picture some of the renderings. Performance, price, options...everything but even as a HUGE Tesla fan the looks are just too far out there. Looks like they forgot to actually sculpt the clay when modeling.
