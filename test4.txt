Feels to me like there’s a lot of unacknowledged misogyny/homophobia. I mean Weinstein was a Democrat. As nice of a fantasy as it might be, voting blue doesn’t absolve someone of toxic traits.

What a lovely and kind thing to say. Social justice is, in a metaphorical way, a bit like the moon. It illuminates our world but the journey to reach it is hard because the distance from where we are to what the world has the potential for being is vast. We can but try.

If he does get acquitted, it's also a reminder of the distance between the media and the law. Weinstein has basically been found guilty in the eyes of the public. Convincing 12 jurors might be much harder.

The sense among journalists I've met covering Weinstein's trial is that he will probably get off. Obviously the jury is still out, but it just goes to show how difficult it is to prosecute sex crimes. Especially ones that happened a long time ago.

Been watching all of the flashbacks to the Avanatti Prime Time Days. Then we have the Harvey Weinstein news. Too bad Jeffrey Epstein isn’t still around. All buddies of Hollywood, Fake News and the kookiest Democrats. Wow!

I would have included other stigmas: race, national origin, and language to name but three, but social justice is an all embracing umbrella term. I just found out about it having its special day and wanted to share it with people who care about such things, i.e., all of us here.

HELP: And without that choice, it is not truly consent when women do as men like Weinstein want them to do even when they don’t physically resist.

With respect, it CAN'T be Avenatti. Weinstein is a sexual predator.

Shouldn't she be at her good friend Weinstein's trial listening to how well she picks friends instead of advising Americans on their president??

Well, Weinstein isn’t staying in a Motel 6. His suite will have a sitting area and probably an office area. So if he suggests a meeting should take place there, it’s doesn’t automatically imply sex. So it’s really awkward to say no. And he has immense power.

When one of his victims managed to escape the hotel room where Weinstein had cornered her, he called up fuckin Peter Jackson to say she was difficult to work with. That phone call lost her a lead role in Lord of The Rings. That's "the position" Harvey puts women in.

Men like Weinstein, Epstein, Trump, etc have "used" women for their own person gain their entire lives. They are way "past due" to be made accountable & punished for their criminal behavior!

It’s incredible how Cosby and Weinstein were walking around without any issues. Court comes *BAM* walkers, canes and respirators out. Appear to look old and frail so the court shows mercy. Bury them under the jail.

No one needs to become an actress or a lawyer. Many women turn down sleazebags like Weinstein everyday. They don't get the parts in Hollywood films. Why are we focused on the women who went along instead of those who refused? We need to change the system not help perpetuate it.

Hey T, I think if Harvey Weinstein and Michael share a cell together all will work out. I mean Harvey will finally have some one who wants to have sex with him and Let's face it Mikey will eat any thing.

This! Weinstein's argument is awful and completely ignores the many power dynamics at play. These women did NOT consent and are NOT responsible for being assaulted.

Gotta find a black man to distract from the pending Weinstein verdict.

Hope Harvey Weinstein's attorney never represents women or children of sexual assault as her statement is victim blaming. See below what women think of her statement. https://twitter.com/ZerlinaMaxwell/status/1228380599263559680?s=20 …

HOW DARE YOU? @ RealDeanCain drove his successful, beautiful, talented wife Mindy to drugs & alcohol, then left her to *eventually* die of her addiction after he ruined her. @ AshleyJudd should give Weinstein groupies no excuse, no explanation, no satisfaction, especially Trumpers.

One wonders if Trump will comment on Weinstein’s sentence. After all, it was only rape! You do know, the “stable genius” is smarter than jurors, prosecutors, and judges. We should be thankful we have such a thoughtful leader. He is our “dear leader” who doesn’t even poop or pee!

The defense contends that the two women he is charged with attacking were opportunists who willingly latched on to Weinstein and acquiesced to sex with him because they thought it would help their careers. https://www.weau.com/content/news/Prosecutor-Weinstein-saw-victims-as-complete-disposables-567881031.html …

I'm amazed at the justice system overall––excluding the AG––this was great to read--sad and unsettling, too. But that lead prosecutor was great. And, yes, # Weinstein underestimated them. Hoping he gets what he deserves, life in # prison.https://twitter.com/jilevin/status/1228380570029350914 …

Harvey Weinstein Was an ‘Abusive Rapist’ and Serial ‘Predator,’ Prosecutor Claims in Closing Arguments http://dlvr.it/RQ2zgS pic.twitter.com/v4vd2ZJTh6

The lyric of “Harvey’s in the sky with diamonds and it’s making me crazy” references Harvey Weinstein the Hollywood r*pist

ultimately the intellectual dark web will not bother policing any of the steaming hot piles of shit they produce - Rubin's show, Weinstein's podcast, Quillette's climate science takes - but the pages of every established liberal rag gets proofread in most asinine pedantic way

Example of shaming women while in office ? Blanket statements don’t help Democrats case while it Epstein, Weinstein who got arrested for these acts.

If that is what she truly believes no wonder she can represent a man like Weinstein.

Yes. And it seems to me if ratings was what they were after this story would bring off-the-charts ratings. There must be more to it- what are they hiding and/or who are they protecting? The Weinstein situation speaks volumes.

This is a Canadian problem? How? Are Cosby and Weinstein Canadians now? Also consenting 20year olds are not trafficked children

Worshiping idols has been a known error of mankind for ages. However, I never heard of a man forcing the removal of a woman's tampon to have oral sex with her until Weinstein. This is an assault against woman, mankind and God. https://sites.google.com/site/hesedken/fornication_culture/weinstein_fornication.html …https://twitter.com/hesedken/status/1228337004166946817 …

how "feminist" of her. Shame on women who betray other women with such smug remarks. But who else would defend Weinstein?

Okay. Now it makes a bit more sense. Just too much. I think if the Epstein case had gone ahead, a connection with Weinstein might have come out. But didn't SDNY kibosh it after Epstein died? (I smell Barr). Epstein did not commit suicide. You can't hang yourself with hands tied.

Donna Rotunno is either totally unaware of her internalized misogyny or she’s literally the devil’s spawn. And she just might get a serial rapist off and go off and buy more designer shoes with her big fat cheque. I haven’t been so repulsed by another human being since Weinstein.

Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno’s closing statement argues that prosecution’s case ‘strips adult women of common sense’ https://wapo.st/2HnyYyD

Exactly. Weinstein is just a freaky old man who used his name & status & these women glady participated in the "casting couch" game. No grown woman who has been genuinely raped by a man writes emails like "Miss ya big guy!" These old groupies jumped on the # metoo bus 4 attention!

Oh, please. Everyone socialized with Weinstein, the most powerful man in Hollywood. Not everyone knew his personal degeneration.

it’s a casting coach power dynamic. i’m not equivocating it to sex with a 16yo student but it’s the same principle of an imbalance in power. i’m not necessarily saying it’s ‘rape’; just that it’s a concern when someone can abuse their power for sex (eg Harvey Weinstein).

He’s a vile human being. If they come back with a not guilty verdict, I’ll scream. I read Catch and Kill by Ronan. The podcast is great, too. Weinstein’s brazen behavior amazes me he wasn’t called out sooner. But, I know victims were afraid.

Weinstein's lawyer is a skank who has learned to excuse and rationalize men's violence by hating other women. If other women get raped/groped, it's their fault. If SHE were to get her ass groped, though, she'd just say it means she's more attractive than other women.

Weinstein and the host of cowardly dick worshiping ilk similar to him are the writ-large social side. Keep women and PoC from the ability to make decisions, yell, shout - howl at the "injustice" of it all, and use toxic masculinity to cow anyone who bucks the status quo.

I’m glad she wasn’t a victim, as a victim myself I don’t wish it on anyone. She has the right to say it just as the victims have the right to tell their stories. As awful as Weinstein was, he’s also entitled to a good defense. You may not like her stmt but it’s her story to tell.

It's accurate that there is a distinction & disparity between the kind of responsibility which comes w/ being a 1st class & 2nd class citizen, and women are adjusting to that reality taking on the good & bad. But Weinstein..idk.. maybe not the ideal person to make that pt with.

Sources close to me (my husband) tell me it’s likely Weinstein will get off. That possibility surprisingly doesn’t piss me off. He’s persona non grata no matter what, so he can just go live out the rest of his days with Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer.

It's a drug. Same drug Heffner & Cosby had in the 60s & 70s. Same drug Weinstein got in trouble for using. Same drug Epstein was using on the plane & island. Subjugation is simple when the subject is drugged into conversion. - So don't you dare try to explain a difference.

Bloomberg is just a more competent version of Trump, he's a racist republican billionaire that hates women and thinks it's good to tax poor people. He was friends with Epstein, Weinstein, and Trump. He's literally trying to bribe his way to the White House.

Missed point. "Fuck no, I'd never let myself be alone with Weinstein, because...<gestures at all the damning evidence there is now>." She's also not a struggling actress who had no clue what was going to happen, nor should it have been a worry. That doesn't absolve him of guilt.

Oh but wait! Would the SNP Transport minister be able to keep the Rest and be Thankful open?

Well, you're saying the alledged behaviour is factual. We don't know if it is. And I'm saying, it's a pretty weak case, that has only gone to court because it's Weinstein

Sounds like the Harvey Weinstein of radical Islam

Do you think actions of Prof. Elizabeth Loftus to testify in defence of Weinstein (continuing the pattern: OJ Simpson, Cosby, Ted Bundy etc) focusing narrowly on how [victim's] memory can be inaccurate, but not on how it can be reliable, are shameful? # MeToo # MeTooSTEM # phdchat

these are the kind of women who set back the # MeToo Movement with their callous disregard for the millions of victims of sexual assault by implying we invited it somehow by our behavior or gullibility or just being in the presence of a predator like Weinstein.

Icymi-Harvey Weinstein’s lawyer is an idiot. Do 10 year old girls put themselves in that position? If a woman is asleep in her locked house, is that putting herself in that position?

His lawyer is also not an actress that unexpectedly put themselves in that position. Weinstein was a known abuser and rapist and the Hollywood elite, who profess to care about women, protected him for years.

That's nonsense, so anytime men disagrees with women they're misogynists? Absolutely not, Gayle and Oprah don't call out other races regarding sexual assaults "Weinstein or Epstein". For example, Brian Banks and other victims neither one talks about these victims.

Okay....I'll admit. I didn't realize that Gayle interviewed the accusers. And come to find our Oprah didn't do the MJ documentary. She did the after show. Probably to control the narrative. She wanted to sit down with Weinstein and he refused. GK interviewed Weinsteins lawyer

HARVEY WEINSTEIN's lawyer, DONNA ROTUNNO, argued yesterday that prosecutors had created a script where women had no responsibility & no one could possibly sleep voluntarily with the move mogul - She claims women used him for jobs & that he's not a monster - Prosecution closes....

Lmfao when Trump got elected immediately they started pursuing sexual harassment in Hollywood. Weinstein knew it was coming to an end. Whatever the fuck those children fuckers got going on

I agree with Weinstein’s attorney. We should always take responsibility for our actions as women.

Prosecutors are looking to focus the jury's attention back on the accusers who testified after Weinstein's lawyer said in a closing argument that he was innocent. https://www.kiiitv.com/article/news/nation-world/harvey-weinstein-closing-arguments/507-38dc638b-509f-40ae-ab96-0e6784d54f29 …

Weinstein's lawyer is a scumbag for bringing Tiger Woods up in comparison.

If Jeffrey Epstein or Harvey Weinstein changed their names would it have made any difference? Legacy issues are still hounding RBS despite what they think

Per esempio, lo stesso giorno in cui hanno proiettato LN al Sundance aveva pure proiettato il doc incentrato sugli abusi di Weinstein. Perché i media non ne hanno parlato? Perché Oprah non ha intervistato le sue vittime ma ha invece dato spazio a due ciarlatani già screditati?

4) happen at that level of wealth and power? I was hoping the podcast would cover the trial even if the book portion about Weinstein ended, but nope. In typical leftist fashion, it began the smashing of @ realDonaldTrump. Really?!? Can we have one thing in life that is NOT

Mah, ti dico, in America per fortuna alcuni stanno iniziando ad aprire gli occhi. È Oprah che pur di coprire i crimini del suo amichetto Weinstein si è inculcata in testa di voler silenziare MJ

GI Jane all the sudden couldn't find her voice?! Liar. She was worried about her pocket and too old to be pursued by Weinstein so she didn't care. Same as Oprah.

Indeed. Its not really all that hidden the majority of film fans like me are aware of it. It's why Harvey Weinstein was championed by so many prior to being outed as a douche. He spent massive sums of money winning Oscars for people. So many of his shit movies won awards

1) @ RonanFarrow # CatchAndKill I’m a podcast junkie so I was excited to listen to a “new” podcaster. The stories about Weinstein were fascinating and sickening all at once. I had heard about him, but knew very little about the charges. He was another powerful man taking advantage

Do you Weinstein and Epstein would have been outed if Loretta Lynch were still the Attorney General?

It's terrible how she's relying on myths and victim blaming. Shows how bad it is for Weinstein that she has to lean on that instead of facts

Therefore, see Weinstein going to prison. If those jurors follow the law, they will find him guilty because there is enough proof that he forced them to have sex against their will. AFTER they said NO.

Harvey Weinstein's lawyer said prosecutors had created an "alternative universe" in which the film producer was a "monster" So did they make these allegations up just to embarrass Harvey; or is this an elaborate 4D # MeToo LARP / PsyOp where Harvey knows how it ends

Honestly I'm just hopping mad anyone could find her embroidered cape "deeply offensive" when she's been just like every other ACTRESS for decades with exactly zero ability to force men like Weinstein to choose women directors. Like. Have we forgotten who exactly runs Hollywood?

Weinstein's accusers were not good witnesses for the prosecution because of their self-serving sexual INTERACTIONS with Weinstein. They were paying to play. But, if at any stage in their sexual ENCOUNTERS, they said NO to Weinstein and he forced himself on them, it's RAPE.

You kept on saying "relationship" as to mean those Weinstein's accusers were his lovers or friends with benefits. They were not.

I’m not saying he’s not funny and I’m not saying Weinstein was not a good producer.

It's not that I don't believe. My gripe was that Franken's alleged adjacent "MeToo" was from a B&W photo when still on SNL. Far as other 7 by your count admitted it wasn't forceful harassment. Nothing of that to lump him in w/ the likes of Weinstein and Cosby. That's just unfair!

# metoo the fact there’s only 2 people that can take Weinstein to court.. too small (when we know there are hundreds!) too late (bcuz there’s a statute of limitations with sexual assault) and he’s just too powerful (look at # OJ) a powerful man is allowed to get away with anything

She haaates men so I doubt she would be interested in your offer. She already has a female ‘times up lawyer’ called Kaplan and that lawyer previously represented Weinstein! They are crooked people, wake up.

What a difference a yr makes. Today, the media see these men as heroes. Last yr, they were racists & warmongers. Harvey Weinstein should come out blasting Trump. He’s in desperate need of an imagine redo. Media loved him once...couple anti-Trump public statements & HE’S BACK! pic.twitter.com/StWAoJRq1r

If # Weinstein is convicted after this eye-opening trial that means women are nothing but brainless little girls with breasts & a vagina & have no responsibility for using their sexual favors to manipulate men 2 get money or fame and that’s ok but when it backfires go to court!

And another very important thing. Natalie Portman says she doesn't like "Rose McGowen's form of protest". McGowen was the first woman calling out Harvey Weinstein as a rapist. Decades ago. Portman made bank; Rose not so much. Filthy Hollywood go alongs.

Fin du procès d'Harvey Weinstein. Sur des dizaines d'accusations, ce sont les témoignages de 2 femmes qui ont été retenus pour le procès. Son avocate a demandé aux jurés de faire appel au "bon sens". Début des délibérations, mardi 18 février. https://f24.my/6AeF.t pic.twitter.com/p6tnSVNKO9

Weinstein has a history of publishing or paying for outlets to publish salacious news about other artists according to an account from the nytimes so he m8 be behind the Kellz stuff too plus he's a "god" in the LA - NYC media highway

What about the fact she is friends and supports Harvey Weinstein, she has done nothing to improve the lives of black people except ride off @ Oprah coattails her whole journalistic career

Harvey Weinstein is a monster. The book contains plenty of stories of men behaving very badly and/or criminally (looking at you, Matt Lauer), but Weinstein stands alone. He deserves to die in prison and then rot in hell.

I would never vote for Trump. If I lived in a swing state, I would vote for Bloomberg, but thankfully, my state reliably votes blue.

Weinstein’s defense attorney made a strong argument against retroactive allegations of rape by women who at the time continued to engage in sex and relations with Weinstein. No plausible evidence that this is normal behavior for a “victim.” Prosecutors rely on past “bad acts”.

Jeb's not a prolific defendant in sexual harassment suits and as far as I can tell doesn't pal around with Weinstein and Trump. Maybe he is/does. Fuck do I even know about Jeb?

Bull-hockey. Besides Stone was a supporter, but a "top Trump ally" is baloney. SWAT invades his home (after alerting the lib media) taking septuagenarian Stone and his wheelchair-bound wife into custody, while Hillary, Weinstein—and Epstein, for a short time—roam free.

Exactly - due process my arse - he’s the only one they are demanding this for - what about Weinstein did they campaign for his due process? They also want us to ‘respect MJ’s rights?’ Are they serious? Sorry love my respect is reserved for MJ’s victims - he can f*ck right off

Didn't Obama give that medal to Harvey Weinstein....

You’re too kind! I know that you initiated this first by posting the comment logged into the The NY Times article on Weinstein before anyone had ever heard of # MeToo. Your foresight to do such a thing plus our collective voices are the ones who launched the Movement. # Founders

I guess we should just take Weinstein & R. Kelly(cash only) & Cobsy's money too. Because we need that money.

Yep, 'young women' not little girls. There is NO evidence, ZERO that Trump ever went to the island or flew on the Lolita when there is a ton of evidence that Clinton did. Just stop with the lies. Clintons were great friends with Weinstein, Epstein, Weiner...all pedophiles.

And therefore I am also a victim" It makes it harder to find real life predators and for anyone in society to take real abuse victims seriously when you're going around advocating for harrasment of people likin drawings over actual abusers being put in bars like Harvey Weinstein

Said while Weinstein is looking for pity by using a walker. Putting emotions aside, facts are that what Weinstein did ruined a lot of lives & can not be ignored.

If Weinstein is found not guilty, the radical feminist meltdown will be quite a few megatons greater than when Hillary lost or Kavanaugh confirmed. If that is followed by a Johnny Depp win...they will go completely ape shit. They see both as # believewomen on trial.

Podcasts and books. I’ve been digging The Portal podcast with Eric Weinstein and I’m reading the book | Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin by Timothy Snyder

Bloomberg sucks but without spending any time researching this I am pretty sure even Weinstein didn’t rack up that many victims. If it seems too crazy to be true then it’s probably not true. Probably counting lawsuits involving his companies or employees.

I just remembered too Michelle let her daughter do an internship with Weinstein. Omg. Internship. What could a black girl learn from a white pedophile rapist? And Michelle knew too. Charges already issued. Wow. What a man Mom.

Not really. You’re at the heart of the 45 divide. We waffle with things like, “My uncle isn’t a racist, but for him racism isn’t a dealbreaker.” I can’t respect someone who “adores” a racist, or a nazi, or a pedophile or Harvey Weinstein.

Exactly! From AFP, sadly, it reflects the society French Muslims find themselves in. In the UK, if it were a priest, yes, relevant; he has taken a vow & is supposed to be more alim than us. But Reynhard, no relevance. Jeffrey Epstein/Harvey Weinstein=being Jewish is irrelevant

Michelle Obama, Whoopi and Hillary all loved Weinstein. He liked them and all the Hollywood actresses he could get his hands on. You ever notice how Hollywood celebs and Democratic politicians adore each other

To their credit, @ PrepHoyaHockey generated many, many quality chances in the 2nd and 3rd periods and continued to play a gritty and determined brand of hockey. Max Weinstein kicked out 19 shots, however, including several Ten-Bell saves for the shutout win.

You do realize he has hardly paid for any of it. It's a public svhool and money was acquired through solitication and donations, including Harvey weinstein. Every dollar spent is tax deductivle. Lebrons foundation paid less than 25 %

In both cases, the allegations came out almost 20 years later and over 20 years in some cases, I think that is pretty telling about how easily the media can convict a person before a trial in cases like these. As far as I can see, the evidence against Weinstein is weak.

1/2 Anyone who has a doubt about the intentions can compare it to the interview King did with Weinstein's lawyer. I didn't know that it happened either She gives -his lawyer- ample opportunity to lay out a defense, repeats that defense later and talks up the lawyer's toughness.

True, but think of it this way. You have never seen a single person investigated as thoroughly as Trump. And still there is nothing to indict him. Stalin's minister of justice said, "Show me the man and I will find the crime". Harvey Weinstein has real accusers and is being tried

She’s a billionaire. What is with billionaires just crying around on the news lately? Poor you. Was best buds with Weinstein but didn’t know. But yet everybody in Hollywood did. She’s an enabler to sexual assault.

Donna Rotunno's Closing Remarks in the Weinstein Case Sound Like a Greatest Hits of Vintage Sexism

I'm saying that media reports out of the courtroom, and extraneous discussion are about what a pig and and disgusting person Weinstein is, and how angry and upset the women are, but nobody outside the courtroom is hearing the arguments as to matter of the law and guilty verdicts.

If Harvey Weinstein is found not guilty, does that prove the whole # metoo movement is a sham, built on lies? If it isn't confirmed already # HarveyWeinstein

You too money from Weinstein

Also in this interview Stanley talked about the last time he worked with Weinstein (c1990?) & how his lead actress called him one night saying harvey was at the door saying if she didnt let him in she'd never work again. So he said keep the door shut & went over & harvey left...

Anyway I was thinking about the type of movie Tarantino makes (pulp to put it too kindly) & how he has had a LONG working relationship with Harvey Weinstein.

Couple years ago Richard Stanley talked about working with Harvey Weinstein & how he was told Harvey had a marketing "genius" & it turned out the "genius" just marketed to the "lowest denominator"...

This may be jumping to a point that isn’t totally there, but I’ve long thought that it’s notable that men like Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein, if not for wealth and power, would be ugly, insecure losers. Their treatment of women flows heavily from the point.

Notice when she was popular & getting Support she was Roseanne. After the Dems got mad she was Trump Supporter Roseanne. We need to take their cue. Hillary & DNC Supporter's & Donors Harvey Weinstein. Hillary DNC Supporter Donor Epstein. Never talk about any w/o DNC Supporter 1st

Given that Weinstein and Miramax were actually KNOWN for "marketing controversy" as a way to drive ticket sales, why not instead accuse Weinstein of becoming a serial rapist because he cynically figured that "any publicity is good publicity"? http://torok.com/articles/marketing/ControversySells.html …

I think it will be a nothing burger. He'll probably talk about Weinstein and some of the Nexium peeps

Once upon a time there was a filmproducer Harvey Weinstein. Later a pornstar to shut up, during elections. Also several women claiming abuse. And more old friends accused. Its very reasonable to think that Donald J. Trump somewhere appears in a strange movie, even made in Moscow.

I can’t think of many people who would make a worse president than Trump. Perhaps Steven Miller or one of Trump’s kids? Or that black MAGA sheriff who likes to torture people? Even Harvey Weinstein would be better president than Trump.

good morning to everyone except donna rotunno and weinstein i hope you get fucking flattened

And on a personal note: I'm fairly confident the jury's NYC common sense is what's going to get Weinstein convicted. Don't let me down, New York.

The tragedy of this is Harvey Weinstein believes this as much as Jeffrey Epstein believed he did nothing wrong to the "girls."

So sad and sickening especially when you know Mrs. O is the mother of two young women vulnerable to such men as Weinstein.

People assume because Weinstein is a gross fat fuck and women are crying on the stand against him he will be slam dunked in court. And when he's not, they will be outraged and use lots of hashtags involving white men. Because nobody outside the courtroom is considering the law.

Weinstein has already confessed to this sort of thing. When he got to be a “somebody in Hollywood,” he said in an amazingly frank interview during the early # MeToo days, “I did offer them acting jobs in exchange for sex.”

That’s horrible that you were told that. Hopefully the jury will be able to push that mentality aside and vote to convict. Weinstein’s predatory nature was an open secret for years, it’s about time he faces justice.

Shame on Gloria Allred emphasizing that Weinstein declined to testify! She KNOWS that cannot be considered evidence of guilt. The guy is a perv but he still deserves a fair trial.

2/ why women don't report. Sciorra also targeted by Weinstein's lawyer as "tough"; she would be equally attacked if she seemed fragile and broken, unstable and weak. Tough women don't get raped? That's the point; someone else is physically tougher so he overrides your will.

It'd be worth $3 just to have her call and find out how many times Weinstein ate the puddin.

Harvey Weinstein might have just hired himself the best criminal defense attorney! Listened to her interview with NYT and she’s voiced exactly everything I feel about the # MeToo movement

There's a problem in that you can shift the definitions of 'sexual' and 'violence' to get arbitrary levels of the problem. For example, the Harvey Weinstein comment seems to imply that the word "violence" is being used in a non-traditional sense here.

I honestly don't have much of a problem with either. @ JimCarrey flirted. The End. Also what trump said was true. When you're rich you can literally grab em by the pu**y. Look at Weinstein and even those gold digger youtube vids. Its proven daily. It just "sounds bad out loud".

Just a thought........ Imagine for a moment if Harvey Weinstein was a “friend” of Trump.......

In the last days of her general election campaign, she was parading around with a war criminal and throwing fundraisers with Harvey Weinstein where Lin-Manuel Miranda performed 'Tim Kaine in the Membrane' to the tune of Cypress Hill. I can't imagine why she lost.

My favorite lectures were from Alan Weinstein (quantum based on Cohen-Tannoudji) and Scott Hughes (GR based on Carroll/MTW/Wald/literature). They were also two of the most energetic lecturers I've ever had! I think that contributed to why I wanted to do research with them.

That's what they said before the revelations about Weinstein were made public. They both condemned him after the revelations.

this Harvey Weinstein trial is receiving very little press. Talking heads on network tv, haven’t said much about the trial. Are we not supposed to know that this is by design? Somebody out there doesn’t want a face like his, to be the face of sexual assault.

A problem here: Cosby was on trial everyday on TV. Weinstein is an “update”. In the division is the notion of Black v White. What happens if Weinstein is aquitted? W/ Epstien dead, no one ever says,”They are going after White men. They are going after Jews”. # silencebreakers https://twitter.com/ProfBlacktruth/status/1228019523263045632 …

might be coincidental, but i just noticed that the same biblical passage (joshua 10:13) cited in the poem that Benjamin attributes to a witness of the July Revolution in thesis XV is taken up in some detail by Spinoza in the TTP. and i’m thinking of Dobbs-Weinstein’s book again.

Have you come across the podcast The Tip Off? The latest ep is about how the journalists uncovered the Harvey Weinstein thing, and the first reaction was “you can’t change this” from the industry. It’s a sick parallel, and I wonder if there’s an equivalent figure in music.

Rotunno told jurors that Harvey Weinstein's rape and sexual assault trial is not "a popularity contest" nor are they here to "criminalize morality." She asked them to find him innocent “no matter how unpopular you might be when you go back home.”

@ JoeNBC when are you going to rant about Gayle Kings relationship with Harvey Weinstein? # istandwithblackmenhttps://youtu.be/Q2Tfjl0Jj94

We can. I’ll also toss in her regular meetings with Weinstein including the private dinner with him after her loss. Or her stay at Epstein’s infamous ranch after the initial charges came out. She’s got serious issues as Trump did

His lawyer is not wrong. If anything, Harvey Weinstein is guilty of solicitation, but they always had a way out. Why wait for his return from the bathroom? They claim to have put their CAREERS over their personal integrity. That's not love of art, they wanted fame and fortune.

I can’t stop thinking about how much money Harvey Weinstein’s lawyer is making to slut shame and gaslight accusers in a courtroom

This is getting confusing. The other 3 might be true & especialy that one with A Weiner is painful, the Weinstein one looks shopped tbh. Do you have further proof this photo is real? like in an article or something. Ain't got time to dive into it now, but will look into it later.

Harvey Weinstein is 'an innocent man,' defense says at closing argument of New York trial https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-13/weinstein-trial-closing-arguments … Except the jury never got to hear from him.

You’re entitled to your opinion of course ... but if you think Harvey Weinstein isn’t at least as famous as Kobe you are absolutely mistaken. Also - https://youtu.be/ZxNDb2PVcoM and https://youtu.be/rgSbSotJgUY . That’s just a smidge of info out there on MJs cases.

There is will-to-power in the intimidation of witnesses, jurors, victims, lawmakers, judges and journalists. Of course. But it seems like a violent impulse also. Menacing behavior like the stalking Ronan Farrow endured fr/Weinstein’s goons. Stone threatened Credico with death.

Daily reminder that Weinstein is innocent

When you're guilty as hell with a looming Prison sentence, your goto strategy is throw yourself upon the mercy of the court and offer a pathetic apology. Too late - we know Epstein and Weinstein were patsies to throw off how bad child trafficking is within the DC-media elite.

One of the accusers went on to be Weinstein's girlfriend, months after the alledged attack...... Another told her friends/room mate that she was one pursuing the sex and wanted to be in a relationship with him......... It's been pretty good for Weinstein, to be honest

Yeah I posted pics of Ghoslaine Maxwell and Weinstein with Bloomy but they reply blocked it. Anyone can google it.

Not that I'm saying that to justify Weinstein, but it does remind me of, say, 'Baby it's cold outside,' which was, when it was written, about two people who were excited to have sex, despite sounding like a woman being coerced.

No idea, but one big difference is that Khomeini & coterie gave impression he was a harmless cleric with no real radical ideological/political objectives fooling US, Saudis, French intellectuals incl Sartre, Foucault, etc. Bernie is a not a dissembler & we all know what he wants.

People still supporting and working with David O. Russell in 2020 makes my skin crawl. He’s Harvey Weinstein in a Directors suit. He should be very much cancelled. Stop supporting abusers.

I don't think the Harvey Weinstein case is a key moment for the # MeToo movement. I think the media wants to frame it that way. Upwards of 80 women have accused him. I hope he goes to jail, but if he doesn't, the work will go on.

As much as I loved other Bong joints, like PARASITE, THE HOST, and the highly underrated MOTHER, this one is his masterpiece. And it's even more rock n roll cause Weinstein tried to bury it. Plus some of Chris Evans best work ever. https://twitter.com/OnePerfectShot/status/1227969684458348545 …

I have no empathy for Weinstein.

No, first one from 2001, so it was already quite old when I saw it. It was pure coincidence I saw it about 2 weeks after the Weinstein news broke. There are so many references to bad behaviour, I was amazed. I wouldn't be surprised if they can't even show this film now.

Years after the fact, she claimed it was her response to Harvey Weinstein’s abuse. Methinks it was more about publicity and attention. @ rosemcgowan is a fraud.

"The narrative that the ability to avoid rape is under the victim's control is probably good for [Weinstein's lawyer's] business, but has no basis in fact." - @ RAINN @ BBCNorthAmerica's @ hollyhonderich breaks it downhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51448445 …

I've only started asking last year. I hope I have better luck than you in getting the answer.

She should hit her friend Harvey Weinstein up for $$

The monster Weinstein was wonderful until his exploits became public. They all knew. One need remember that if a person is perfectly fine with slaughtering babies up to birth, a little rape won't even phase him. Boys will be boys, right @ MichelleObama and @ HillaryClinton?

The fact that a # BirdsOfPrey review exists where the writer refers to Harley as a "stumble-drunk drinker" which makes her "touchable in the Harvey Weinstein sense" is beyond disgusting. And some editor somewhere thought this was okay to publish... pic.twitter.com/zkSGdvheMS

According to the recent Weinstein accusers testimony it would be 'matchstick V longsword'.

For our first issue of the spring, we interviewed Lucia Evans '05, who took part of some of the first criminal charges brought against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein for an alleged sexual assault that occurred the summer before her senior year at Middlebury. (2/3)

Of course not & Michelle Obama hit the campaign trail (lying) referring to Donald Trump as a sexual predator bc of WORDS he spoke to Billy Bush MO allowed Harvey Weinstein & Lena Dunham (HBO Girls) to mentor their teenage daughter, preparation for their family production comp.

We can’t trust Twitter now I just answered a message About Harvey Weinstein Michelle Obama was speaking about how wonderful he was an she was giving a tribute to him I commented,don’t see it?protecting the Obamas who paying to protect criminals we don’t know who they are SOROS?

This rhetoric is the reason why you see black people out here advocating for Bill Cosby and r kelly in the name of “solidarity” or “but what about Weinstein.” This idea that we will all b unified no matter what the cost is flawed, and we are under no need to do it. Let it go.

I clerked for 3 years in the EDNY. I didn't have the honor of clerking for Judge Weinstein, but he is a LEGEND, in all caps. 98 years old! His judgment, integrity and insight far surpasses most judges. He will be sorely missed.

Update: Moments before closing arguments, Justice Burke makes triple sure that Weinstein does *not* wish to testify, saying: "Given your subsequent statements, I wanted to make absolutely certain..." Weinstein answers "yes" as Burke asks him 3 times to remove all doubt. @ Law360

They all went to the same seminar. When a hardened criminal gets released: "FEAR TACTICS!" When a 5 time felon commits manslaughter and he can't be held: "FEARMONGERING!" All the time: "You just want to lock up the poor!" [Actually, we'd be 100% ok if Weinstein was remanded.]

Ever seen "Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"? It's a Weinstein production I saw just after the news broke. So many jokes had a new significance. e.g. Man: I need to talk to you Chris Rock (playing a producer): Well, be quick. I got a trailer full of white girls waiting for me!

Wow... Hadn't seen this before... FLASHBACK Michelle Obama 'Harvey Weinstein is a Wonderful Human Being' https://youtu.be/r5lTpmF924Y via @ YouTube

Why don't somebody do a me to documentary? On these priests to rate these little children. Do you want me to documentary on Harvey Weinstein Jeffrey Epstein Charlie Sheen. Google me to documentary on the owner of OWN Network. Oprah knows who we are convicted of pedophilia

OMG Had passed an didn’t listen or watch because of her and then I decided to WHAT?? Harvey they r praising Harvey Weinstein, sad what’s happening to him but he brought it on himself an look at all the people involved that are just guilty! Should all be punished. God will judge

Weinstein Corporation has produced more important Black films that any other movie production company. Oprah opened up the conversation around childhood molestations and abuse. Michelle taught every girl that she is beautiful and can be anything she wants. Whoopi is the best.

Looks like a list of people that fed Weinstein women.

They're vetted for a reason bro. To ensure they don't have biased thoughts that would be unfair to the accussed. So you'd be good with Harvey Weinstein as lead juror in a Bill Cosby trial? Obviously that would be the most extreme example, but shows the issue.

“BIG MIKE” giving a shout out to Harvey Weinstein from the podium and telling everyone, “he’s a wonderful human being,” and “we all know him” That’s great

not attacking him.. i honestly didn't know he stood against weinstein.. as far as Trump goes, he's not a saint, we all knew that. I believe it's highly more likely women have been paid to smear him...just like Kavanaugh... the truth will come out in the end, i hope i'm right.

@ SeemaCourtTV Women who grew up in abusive families tend to have a broken self-esteem & lacks self-respect, often feeling like they deserve the abuse & can’t do any better. Sticking around to be abused repeatedly by Harvey Weinstein is no surprise. 80+ women aren’t lying.

This is not wrong, but Weinstein deviated from precedent out of disagreement, not ignorance — he wasn’t wrong about the current state of the law, but trying to push it in his preferred direction. That’s not generally ideal judicial behavior, but he did it as well as anyone could.

Also, the fact that she has criticized (not attacked,btw) white celebs for this same thing in the past, proves your race-baiting theory is BS. She’s criticized Weinstein, and other Hollywood celebs telling people to not listen to their opinion and it had nothing to do with race.

They are not only going after black men. If you watched Gayle on TV you would know how much she covered Weinstein. You would know that she interviewed Woodyallen's daughter. But you're just following some false narrative from the internet.

I’ve seen a few of these (there was a Weinstein one) where the image and the charicature have not only the same energy, but it could be a re-enactment. Filthy vermin. Deserving of all our contempt.

Yes, it is cool to go after rapists. Anyone who actually loves their people thinks it's GREAT to go after those who attack their women. Weinstein was a daily topic on her show, she interviewed his attorney, but can't interview him if he doesn't sit down for one.

But yet Gayle still does not mention anything of her buddy Harvey Weinstein. Am I in the twilight zone

Funny how this policy seemed to be instituted in Dem run cities. What have the people done to show they are reformed after instituting such policies. Weinstein says he's not a rapist, but everybody knows he is. Talk is cheap.

And you know this hell any blind person can see this you mean to tell me it's coo to go after Kobe, Cosby, Kelly...,but not Harvey Weinstein and her other friends body counts are higher than all three are there is together yet @ GayleKing, @ Oprah, @ AmbassadorRice say nothing hmm

There’s no hope for the elections of 2020 if everyone’s lying there with their legs open while Harvey Weinstein on steroids (Zuck and Booty-gig), drunk on their own power, have their way with the American public. In short, we’re about the be f*d. But we can # SHUTFACEBOOKDOWN NOW

Again @ morningmika @ JoeNBC the threat and language used by # SnoopDogg were unnecessarily crude, but once again (as with Kap), White folks are overlooking the point. @ GayleKing line of questioning doesn't fall upon Weinstein (Oprah's fav), Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose...question them! pic.twitter.com/vmGSb45af5

You are right they interviewed people about Weinstein however to equate him to Kobe who was a victim of a mentally ill white woman without detailing both sides is malpractice on Gayle's part. Tha and the timing was more than insensitive.

What if is wasn't Katherine Ryan and was a young, impressionable female. What if it wasn't in public. Where would @ slowthai have stopped? Another Weinstein in the making, using his "power" over women.

Considering it's taken years for women to come forward about Weinstein, and that child sexual abuse is IMO more damaging psychologically, as well as the fact that these people have control over actors careers, I'm not surprised he's waited to speak out.

Hi @ kerrywashington you, ma'am, are Awesome!!! I believe that the issue isn't in the questions asked. The issue is why are @ Oprah and @ GayleKing not asking the hard questions to Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, etc? 45 has 2 sexual assault cases in NY now. # equalopportunityreporting

No lo sé, tengo la sensación de que se le quiere dar una impronta que no tiene a estos premios. Es cierto, hay lobby, pero yo creo que con Weinstein fuera, quizás ya no sea tan salvaje...

Powerful men who got away with rape, it wasn't just Weinstein, he was also enabled by his political connections.

A lawyer for Harvey Weinstein is expected on Thursday to urge a New York jury to acquit the former Hollywood producer of sexual assault, as the weeks-long trial against Weinstein comes to a close.

Rose McGowan is quite literally a fraud. She was all up in arms over Weinstein & other men who were accused of these atrocities, yet defended her friend who did the SAME THING because she was a woman. Rose McGowan believes women are incapable of SA. Rose is a fraudulent feminist.

FUCK GAYLE!! She comes at Kobe after his death and got EXACTLY what she deserved! She says NOTHING about Weinstein, Lowe, or Allen, ALL rapists!! She comes at Cosby, Kelly, and Kobe! Fuck her!

What did the LA County prosecutors, detectives and police know to make them behave so stridently? What inside information did they have. A few years ago, people like you would have scoffed at the Weinstein & Spacey allegations 'cause YOU don't "bother to learn" about the details

Well there is a horror show if you ever saw one. Where is Harvey Weinstein to round out the pic? He is a special fave of the elites. # ThursdayThoughtshttps://twitter.com/2Thedogpound/status/1227906112256606211 …

Because Harvey Weinstein is a Jew as was Epstein and many others in positions of power and wealth. They don’t identify as black or white that is just part of the race industry they have created and profit from. Like Islam you cannot question Judaism/Zionism or indeed Israel

You're right and they still haven't said anything about Gayle's relationship with Harvey Weinstein nor the pictures of them together and he's a serial rapist

Where is your outrage for Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose and Weinstein? They have done worse allegedly.

the documentary is irrelevant. Oprah & gayle devoted hours of coverage to the weinstein scandal: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sylviaobell/selma-hayek-oprah-harvey-weinstein …

Definitiv. Nimm z.B. Den Fall H. Weinstein. Wie sich jetzt heraus stellt, hat, laut Seal's Angaben, Oprah von seinen Übergriffen schon lange gewusst. Warum hat sie ihre Reichweite nicht dafür genutzt es aufzudecken? Oder nimm den Fall K. Spacey. Aber das sind nur Beispiele. pic.twitter.com/6bfxIuR5Az

4. Love or hate Kobe and/or MJ, both of them never verbally expressed hatred against black people. Cosby, however, verbally expressed a lot of hatred, while Weinstein financially screwed over a lot of black people.

Any normal person wouldn’t a President get away with such derogatory terms, Trumps no better than Weinstein when it comes to women, again these MAGA cult members could see trump stab a man on stage and they’d still vote for him, normal people wouldn’t, they’d reconsider.

I agree. I just HATE when bad people (see Weinstein, for example) maximise their "pity score" by highlighting their illnesses. But I agree, faking illness is usually uncommon - and I prefer believing over not believing all day long.

Good morning. We’re live in Lower Manhattan ahead of closing arguments in the Harvey # Weinstein rape trial. He never took the stand. Facing life in prison. There’s also a pending case in Los Angeles. # abc7NY https://7ny.tv/2SlSRwk pic.twitter.com/d64z86jHkD – bei Supreme Court, New York County

Last night listened to two male "friends" carping on - Harvey Weinstein is innocent, girls asking for it, etc. My husband intervened and was called the C word for his trouble. Now my husband is a big geezer. I walked off and left the two shits to their fate.

I don't think it's complicated. The understanding at the time was that existing precedents were politically conservative and that Weinstein would ignore them in favor of politically liberal alternatives.

Didn't realize there was an ongoing feud but see now that it began with Oprah being all chummy with Weinstein & then burning down black men who pale in comparison. Then Gayle went in on Lisa. It was a roll out. It was too much.They belong to the Illuminati,a club devoid of race.

Weinstein's attorney clearly must have limited contact, or just is utterly ignorant to the fact that sexual assault is more likely to be perpetrated by someone known and who is trusted.

Says the woman that has committed more crimes than Trump and who’s husband flew to Orgy Island with Weinstein.

Really? And that is what offends you, say, more than Weinstein's shenanigans?

They only care about themselves and their careers. Never mind protecting women. That’s why people like him, Clinton, and Epstein get away with stuff like this. Epstein was going to bury them all. I can’t imagine the dirt he had on them all. Weinstein too. They were scared of them

Pretty sure that was Harvey Weinstein’s catch phrase

I meant Harvey Weinstein !

As you stated you dont understand our culture. Snoop did not threaten Gayle he checked her and brought voice to what many in the black community was thinking. @ GayleKing worked with Charlie Rose and is silent about Les Moonves and Harvey Weinstein but attacks Kobe Legacy.

She's not exactly "withholding relevant facts" -- she's getting paid a handsome sum to testify on his behalf. Weinstein's legal team knows full-well her track record of supporting scumbags using the tried-and-true: "my research indicates the victim probably made it all up, oops!"

You mean like Bill, Weinstein, Epstein, etc? They’re the sex traffickers and rapists and all are Democrat’s.

first woman i have seen with the jeff bezos / harvey "the larvae" weinstein droopy eye. unfortunate but not surprising considering who she married..

Don’t be ridiculous! Harvey Weinstein has nothing to do with this. Gayle King would interview him if she could! She is not responsible for and did not know of his crimes! She has to ask tough questions! Snoop was wrong to threaten her.

Well by this logic men should not be on Harvey Weinstein juror because he’s a man that sexually assaulted women. pic.twitter.com/cgOdOa2SDA

The # MeToo movement revealed how victims of sexual assault were often silenced by those in authoritative positions. While the Harvey Weinstein case is confined only to the facts specific to the case - the outcome has implications for women everywhere. https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/social-affairs/harvey-weinstein-v-metoo …

I get snoop apologized cus he did insult her & the whole “ dont make cus come after you “ did sound threatening but a 2nd apology pls where is her interview with Harvey Weinstein victims ? Since she wanna speak on rape cases?!

Snoop checked Gayle letting her know the black community is calling her out for duplicity on Harvey Weinstein and ignoring white male sex predator like Les Moonves @ AmbassadorRice is a former NSA who is threatening an Army response to Snoop For calling out @ GayleKing

Apologized for the language, not the message. Did Gayle ever question Oprah about her relationship with Harvey Weinstein?

Amazed to find that Weinstein cited an article of mine in his final opinion. Didn’t see that coming. Just read his bio—he must be among the last judges to experience the Depression & serve in WWII. An incredible career & reminder that those events happened only one lifetime ago.

@ rosemcgowan u r a hypocrite urself. Why didn’t u turn Weinstein in when he perpetrated these acts upon u? Because u hadn’t made a name for urself yet and u needed him. Once u “made it”, u exposed him, but as a woman u should not have waited years! U r just another hypocrite

Febrauray 2020: Roger Stone will be pardoned and he and the recently aquitted Harvey Weinstein will host a Fox News show called 'Zimmer FRAMED' or some such shit, and will moan forever about their trials, whilst gloating about avoiding justice. And then in March...

Celebrities . No one cares about their opinions. Do you have a problem with Hollywood covering for Weinstein?

It's really relevant with what's going on right now, and all the same names connected. Epstein, Weinstein,Trump, could go on. I follow @ kirby sommers. She's a survivor of Epstein from years..ago grown now and a writer (in hiding) fascinating

Ever hear of RINOs? It has been proven that Mueller himself lied to Congress. The probe was not run by Reps. If it were Mueller would not have hired Weinstein & 17 other Dem attys. And despite all the corruption, subpoenas. 1.5M docs, they only proved POTUS was innocent!

The first indictment will be..... Oprah Winfrey Strong ties to Weinstein Strong ties to John of God Schools in Africa reported to be involved in child trafficking

How stupid are you? NBC buried both the Weinstein and Lauer stories. They had to take a stand and that meant firing a guy who suggests a 3some to a coworker whether he’s a janitor or an on air personality. Joke or not. At work or not. # startrespectingwomen

What a ridiculous comment. MJ is a million times more famous than Weinstein so of course his doc got more attention. But oprah did a whole hour with Weinstein’s accuser & gayle grilled his lawyer. They were tougher on Weinstein than on MJ even though the latter never settled

He did. You are correct. You can dig up a photo of any actor and Weinstein. Brad confronted HW and said “if you make Gwyneth uncomfortable again I will kill you” he also banned Harvey from set of a film that he was working on after finding out HW became a producer.

That's where liberals lose , voting based off who the opponent is rather than the person y'all want and represents your argument .. At this point seems like Harvey Weinstein could run against Trump and liberals will just go like , "Well , there're good things and bad things"

As a journalist without a day in law school, I’ve argued before exactly one federal judge: the great Jack Weinstein. The US Atty wanted to seal a courtroom and he let me make my case past the bar. He even offered a stay. An absolute thrill and honor. https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-brooklyn-federal-judge-jack-weinstein-20200212-2wibm2eamfcizhh6uqekvkcmha-story.html …

We all know Weinstein used to have a huge influence which is how he lured actresses, with the promise he'd make them big Hollywood stars but if they refused, he'd tell them they'd never get work anywhere or forced himself on them, disgusting man, glad he was exposed eventually.

I know, right? How do you even start to describe Judge Weinstein's influence when he was a giant in so much of the law, across so many decades?

Congrats to Judge Weinstein on his retirement. A giant in the field of complex litigation, a friend of @ brooklynlaw , and a scholarly presence on the bench.https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-brooklyn-federal-judge-jack-weinstein-20200212-2wibm2eamfcizhh6uqekvkcmha-story.html …

Jeffrey Epstein ~ Harvey Weinstein ~ Benghazi ~ Monica Lewinsky ~ Uranium one ~ Bill Clinton you've got enough to think about,

A lot of these people are resigning before they get accused. Martha Bashfor, aNY prosecutor, came under fire for how she handled Harvey Weinstein’s trial. And then she decided to resign days before the decision came down

Harvey Weinstein is finding this out.

Who else? Epstein, Cosby, Weinstein?

I hope it is not too impolite, while recognizing Judge Weinstein's well-deserved retirement and many years of service, to note that of all the opinions of his I have read, I consistently found them incorrect on the law. https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-brooklyn-federal-judge-jack-weinstein-20200212-2wibm2eamfcizhh6uqekvkcmha-story.html …

Like Weinstein using that "prop" walker to get into the courtroom, Ole bobmueller, was using the "dementia prop" I do believe, to set the stage for a mental Defense. He knew he was lying like a rug. while taking tax money for 2.5 yrs. Smart enough to steal from taxpayers!

You mean Bill Clinton or Weinstein....maybe Ellen?

Ken, I understand your concern, and I guess my logic is that if you make your living off your looks, then you are subject to critique. I did not mention anything about her willingness to prostitute her self to Weinstein if she won an Oscar.

I haven’t seen any of that “evidence”. Meanwhile Weinstein’s close affiliation with the Obamas and the democrat party right up to the day he was arrested bothers you so little that all you want to do is talk about Trump and Epstein knowing each other 15 years ago. Sheesh

Amazing how often McGowan, who protected Weinstein for money, targets people who try to fight the MeToo fight. Like a terrorist picking off first responders.

I'd note here that he also gave them life sentences, and adamantly did not budge when they requested elder parole. Judge Weinstein could compartmentalize like that.

leo lo de Weinstein y me parece un guión de una película de Hollywood, que vaina pa loca

Weinstein should do the time if he raped or sexually abused all of those women but I doubt he raped all of them. Some of you wanted a job so badly, you'd do anything to get it, even abandon your decency & moral integrity. Go see "Bombshell". Could've said NO!

What he's guilty of is taking what was a private anecdote from a vacation with his wife and the co-worker involved and using poor judgment in sharing it publicly. What he did wasn't ok and NBC letting him go is understandable,but lets not pretend the guy is Harvey Weinstein

Yeah, crude was the wrong word. General purpose is what I meant. Notes app, Google Sheets and a backlog sorted by priority goes a very long way!

She will continue to support Charlie Rose, and Oprah will continue supporting Harvey Weinstein. These women abandoned Bill Cosby, like rats on the Titanic. For the record, I’m not a follower of Cosby, RKelly, RSimmons etc. my argument is “equal treatment.”

Bong Joon-Ho refused to make Snowpiercer the way Weinstein wanted it made. So Weinstein delayed the premiere, barely promoted it, and gave it a limited release despite the all star cast, just to show Bong he could. It was a classic “Don’t cross Harvey” cautionary tale.

Sounds like McGowan hates herself for going along with whatever allegedly happened between her and Weinstein.She should have walked out on him & not accepted his money.

Wonder will she say the same about charlie rose and Harvey Weinstein . Seriously...I wonder would people have acted the same if it were Candace Owens or diamond and pearl?

Yes, that lady was pretty much offering sex in exchange for one of the top three parts. Harvey Weinstein would be pleased.

let's not forget that just because the harvey weinstein cases victim claimed that he might be intersex does not make intersex people sexual predators or harassers a gender/race/sexuality does not make anyone an automatic sex predator

Where is Matt Lauer? What channel is the 24 hour Harvey Weinstein trial on?

I do have some problems with this tho "The music industry is taking action like never before to address the growing mental-health crisis." In related news, Harvey Weinstein is taking action like never before to address the growing sexual-assault crisis

Had to google what he was ‘cancelled’ for. Sexting other women while in a r’ship doesn’t make you husband material but he’s not exactly Weinstein is he? Am I missing something?

Ou traduits en justice (Weinstein, limite tu lui filerais un dollar).

@ ClamsAndCockles c'mon Ross, Louie is still one of the funniest people on Earth. Let's not go overboard with the outrage. He was out of line but hes not Weinstein

Yeah, I think one of his films was Weinstein's

Weinstein fut un élève de Qara Qarayev (/ Kara Karayev / Gara Garayev), compositeur azéri emblématique, formé au style soviétique le plus superficiel qui sévissait dans la région. Je n'ai jamais entendu la musique de Weinstein en revanche, qui a aussi officié au cinéma.

Still waiting on that Surviving Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Sheen, Matt Lauer, Les Moonves and Charlie Rose documentary btw

Pero, no entiendo, por qué presenta las fotos la acusación con objeciones de la defensa de Weinstein?? Algo no cuadra... Creo.

And are you talking about Weinstein or the account that posted the picture of her with her friend and great accomplice Weinstein?

About plagiarism: They'll definitely use a Harvey Weinstein tactic in begging for their secret with the promise of work. That's bull too. They only understand and utilize force. Showbiz facilitates victimization.

The Weinstein picture is a fake. But Obama did give a Medal of Freedom to Robert "punch him in his fu*king face" DiNero.

Imagine to dare to say Weinstein wasn't protected your level of racism is mind blowing disgusting. The pig used to use national enquire and news of the world to publish salacious stories about Michael Jackson to deflect the attention from him

Remember when she didn't say anything about Harvey Weinstein in exchange of $$$$ and now she wants to be called a hero and feminist?

Have you listened to the NYT interview with Weinstein's lawyer yet? It is...SOMETHING.

He said, she said. If we don't take accusations seriously, there is no catching Weinstein, Cosby etc. No Me Too movement. It is absurd to conclude that he is lying from her print. If I don't agree to meet my girlfriend, does that make her not my girlfriend? Hearsay on both sides

Defense rests in Weinstein trial https://youtu.be/1PUI_O9QWyI via @ YouTube

What he's guilty of is taking what was a private anecdote from a vacation with his wife and a co-worker (not coworkers) and using poor judgment in sharing it publicly. What he did wasn't ok and NBC letting him go is understandable,but lets not pretend the guy is Harvey Weinstein

People are mainly mad at the fact that this situation resurfaced an got talked about with someone who was friends with Kobe. The issue ties into how Gayle brought up a alleged rape case but there are plenty others (Harvey Weinstein) an gayle doesn’t bring those up in interviews

I would rather watch a sloth clam a 200 ft tree then watch anything you promote, direct, or have ties to. You knew about Weinstein and did nothing. That's just one example. Soo much more to say but I will wait!!

I am interested in seeing how quickly the Avenatti trial closed versus the drawn out process for the Weinstein trial. They both ended about the same time but the Avenatti jury will likely be done before the Weinstein jury gets the case. Odds?

a) that's not a point in his favour, and accepting funds from sex creeps is actually why a lot of liberals, progressives and leftists hate the Democrats (cf. Weinstein) b) plenty of rich and powerful sex creeps don't get charged or arrested. don't see how that's relevant.

her new job is to go after Weinstein.

Watching Snowpiercer right now. Yes, there are some Parasite actors in it. Yes, H Weinstein tried to force Bong to make it his way.

How about...as a woman, I’m sick of actresses who sold their snatches to Weinstein in the 90s preaching about feminism & woman power while they distort their faces with plastic surgery to try to lie about their natural aging process. She looks terrible.

So what about Weinstein was he a criminal too I. Hollywood hyocitice get wife he not going anywhere in 5 years get over it

Weinstein getting owned by the news guy is the content I like to see

A me uno l’altro ieri mi ha minacciato con un : comunista di merda ti faccio passare i guai. Ho semplicemente detto che se salvini non sapeva che il tifoso milanista era uno spacciatore, nemmeno rula poteva non sapere che weinstein era uno che ci provava con tutte.

It's the same as Mr. Weinstein saying that he was/is an women's advocate .....

Trump's a Republican, right? Bill Clinton is a pedo too, so is Graham, the prince, Dersh, Weinstein, etc. Raping children should be abhorred by every decent person in the world.

Shes 100% spot on. The reason why nobody labelled Weinstein as a rapist is because he and the women accusing him were engaged in a form of prostitution

Willful ignorance. I'd like to see Weinstein show bruises he sustained in police custody, like MJ. I'd also like to hear tell of how they searched Weinstein's mom's home & illegally took documents from his lawyer's office. You know nothing of these cases, but have so much to say.

1. You are sick. She came forward about Weinstein. I haven’t done research about her views on Clinton but if you are tweeting then you have access to Google. Use it. I charge to do research.

One day there will be a Harvey Weinstein biopic - Joaquin Phoenix will gain 75 pounds to play him - It will be up for Best Picture - The real Harvey will have back end points

Weinstein’s lead defense lawyer gained the upper hand by sticking to principles of procedural justice and the criminal case itself, but she sounded so released at the end that she was trapped into one little question and sounded less persuasive. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736?i=1000464899201 …

No, they need USMLE scores like Weinstein needs a walker. It's a crutch so u believe the process is objective. Every PD has violated policy for the right applicant. They're already looking to pick people for better organizational dynamics. Nobody wants an incorrigible genius.

I think Weinstein will beat the charges. Prosecution’s case seems flimsy at best.

Apologizing? Unlike Harvey Weinstein where there's evidence that prove that he have done it. Michael didn't have no evidence to prove that he done it. If you haven't show it.

Nope I’m not racist for noticing people like Kobe Bryant, OJ, and Michael Jackson (all black obviously) have gotten easy treatment for their crimes, yet Harvey Weinstein gets the ringer...because he wasn’t black and famous enough to be “exonerated”.

It’s basically all the things I love and have covered for 30 years in Hollywood. Actors. Pop culture. Singers. Entertainers. Multi million dollar empire building women. Wrestlers. Crime (Manson and Weinstein victims) cancer. Adoption. sex. Single motherhood to start!!!

And catch our interview with Avshalom Weinstein, who with his father have restored violins associated with the Holocaust for this project. https://jazzhallradio.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/violins-of-hope-avshalom-weinstein-talks-with-saahara-about-holocaust-remembrance-project/ …https://twitter.com/cityofbhamal/status/1227685133278470151 …

So are you accusing the people who came forward about her abuse to be liars? Because, in parallel, Harvey Weinstein raped/assaulted a lot of women, but I’m sure he didn’t rape/assault *every* women he met/worked with; so do the non-victims vitiate those who spoke out against him?

When in 2018 (I think?) the whole Weinstein scandal broke and the # MeToo hashtag started, I saw 2 female friends that had been raped (on facebook). I was completely shocked, because I did have (a naive, at the time) belief that I wouldn't know anyone that had been. It's insane.

Exactly that is one of the main problems Hillary had. Many saw her as having been unfairly anointed. One consequence of that was that some people chose not to vote, or vote for Johnson or Stein.

Not in these photos but I’ve seen photos with Hillary and Weinstein. You also know there are tons with Hillary and Weiner. Everyone knows this! https://twitter.com/ifeedthecrows/status/1227643660193456128 …

EVERYONE knew Weinstein was a terrible creep and a disgusting pervert, so it was emotionally satisfying to see him cut down. But did the destruction of other creeps follow? Kevin Spacey isn't acting, but he's out there doing his thing, having his accusers knocked off one by one.

Quand j’entends l’avocate de Weinstein dire « je n’ ai jamais été agressée sexuellement, parce que je ne me met jamais dans une telle situation », ça me met donne des sueurs froides de savoir qu’une femme peut dire une telle horreur en 2020.

You should be the one facing 7-9 years in jail, he does not deserve a sentence like that with you walking free. 7 years is what rapist get like your buddy Harvey Weinstein should get.

Surviving sexual assault happens in stages. The women who have stood up against powerful men like Weinstein and Epstein showed that despite the threat of danger -- the desire to be set free is stronger. The desire to survive sexual assault is strong.

As we have publicly witnessed, with both the Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein cases - these men used every arsenal they could get their hands on to silence their victims. They did this to escape accountability for their crimes and to keep it out of the public arena.

No reason to 'back up' accused predator Harvey Weinstein. So many accusations by so many women; he's confessed having been abusive; and is the suspect in an ongoing trial, charged with five felony counts. Compare that to Allen: no charge & no credible allegation were ever made.

Newsflash, Eric Weinstein and Tucker Carlson are elites too. Too many still think neoliberalism is hegemonic. If Tucker Carlson is talking the way he is, neoliberalism is no longer hegemonic.

Yes, its American, and Weinstein raped a lot of women along with Cosby and Clinton but I guess that is ok with you. Major double standard there. Try again.

Harvey Weinstein and the # MeToo movement is not specific to Hollywood. Mediocre men who don’t get what they want from women (sex) trash-talk/vilify those women to punish them, & soothe their own evil ego, are JUST AS predatory. These monsters destroy innocent lives. It’s not ok.

Yup, I’m antiestablishment/anti-elite too. But I’m not motivated by that to the point where Tucker Carlson and Eric Weinstein are my fellow travelers. Some leftists are better described as anti-liberal than leftists. But being antiestablishment isn’t merely being anti-liberal.

I'd argue the worst thing Weinstein did in that particular story was buy Duffy's script and thus allow him to start believing he was the second coming. Weinstein's buried some great films, but Boondock Saints isn't one of them.

It’s from the same stable as first Jeremy Hunt and now Matt Hancock wearing a lapel pin with NHS on it.

después de ver la movida que hubi con Weinstein y esta peli me veo casi obligado a verla

Now do you plan on going after all your athletes, music and Hollywood stars because they've done and said far worse to women. Look at Weinstein, Matt Lauer and more... oh even that AG in NY. They were trashing Trump for what he SAID yet look at what they actually DID. HYPOCRITES!

Will you demand Weinstein intervention too? You are all cut from the same cloth.

No problem. I'd let Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Al Franken, Aziz Ansari, Louis CK, Harvey Weinstein, the students from the Hunting Ground, Brock Turner, move into my house any day. Maybe not you or R Kelly though.

You don't have to work in the same industry to know someone. The president has avenues to many people we probably don't even know about. Obama's daughter was an intern at a Weinstein company. So apparently they were close enough.

You are absolutely correct... then the other journalist are making her the victim! It’s wrong on some many different levels and you are correct If the movement is so important to you. Why aren’t you interviewing Harvey Weinstein?

Harvey Weinstein’s trial one rape and one sexual assault charge The Nypd had that tape like Mike Cohen had on Potus

Hopefully Harvey Weinstein cosplaying an elderly person who cannot afford to have his suit pressed earns him a promotion to the next circle of hell. https://twitter.com/vulture/status/1227588792938385408 …

What's really cool is that fitting a single model across all sites combined produces better predictions that training only on the local site being evaluated. This suggests that there is potential for a single general model for predicting crowns from RGB across forest types.pic.twitter.com/XYnSp2z88w

Pre-training (using LIDAR segmentation-based crowns) on sites other than the target and then fine tuning using ~1000 hand labeled crowns from the target site performs almost as well as full local training.pic.twitter.com/TZ7BUN7MR3

So you are saying the Harvey Weinstein was her only career choice in Hollywood? This is 100% untrue. She sought a shortcut to success. You are trying to provide her cover for reasons beyond comprehension, but know that you do so at the expense of actual victims of sexual assault.

Harvey Weinstein, who is on trial in Manhattan for rape and sexual assault, will not testify, his defense attorney said in court on Tuesday https://vult.re/2HfER0T

Unsurprisingly when models are trained on the target site they produce better predictions then when trained on other sites and used to predict the target site.pic.twitter.com/i790t7kgVY

ok...yea, the botox. but lets not over look she knew about Weinstein in 1997 and didnt try to get the word out about him...while victims piled up

Absolutely. There’s a time to ask these dumb questions. Not while they’re mourning and preparing for funerals. Why didn’t she interview her friend Weinstein?

To help address this we've been looking at how to generalize tree detection from RGB photographs across forest types in work led by the amazing @ ben_weinstein with @ sergio_marconi, @ ProfZare, Stephanie Bohlman, & me. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101061 …

Harvey Weinstein deserves to be acquitted based on the statements given by the two women he's on trial for. They kept in contact with him & sent loving emails. They went out of their way to contact him. I would never go out of my way to keep in touch with someone who harmed me https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1227579851332374528 …

With friends like Weinstein, who needs enemies? It's been said, you can tell who a person is by the company they keep. Throughout my life, I've found that to be true. https://twitter.com/ConservaMomUSA/status/1225908000239517696 …

Pretty sure that holding up the advancement of one's career in order to get them to fuck you is a type of victimization. We can disagree on where to draw the line on victimization, but I'm not gonna pretend that what happened to those actresses with Harvey Weinstein was right.

Parler de Kirk Douglas ( et Epstein, & Weinstein) la rendrait du coup plus légitime pour évoquer la face sombre de Kobe Bryant? Elle apparaitrait ainsi moins "vendue", c'est ça? 2 blancs vaudrait ainsi un noir?

But how many women suffered because you and Streep, and Roberts and others never called out Weinstein? All those years you knew and said nothing. You had fame and money, why did you let all those women suffer?

This is the point though, I doubt there is a big enough group that really wants to stop Bernie. They might not like him, but they will stand behind the nominee against Trump. Obama wants to campaign against Trump; he can do this more effectively if he doesn't endorse anyone.

2 parts for me mate. 1.) Your Cosby/Weinstein example is spot on. I don’t see how people could argue this 2.) also in this specific case SA didn’t even need to report him to The Hague. Not arresting Al Bashir was contravention *of our own laws.* The state just went rogue

but gayle did a very tough interview with weinstein's lawyer. she doesn't single out black men.

We not gon let you Harvey Weinstein the kid good morning @ GayleKing can I live!?

"Victim?" She was under no duress vis a vis Weinstein or anyone else in Hollywood. She wanted glamour and success, and did anything to achieve it, and admitted it. You diminish real victims of sexual assault by covering for her Machiavellian choices.

Oprah should not get involved with Gayle King situation. Gayle did it to herself. So many stories out there to do about rape and abuse. Prince Andrew, Jeffries Epstein. Harvey Weinstein. Whit bosses uses black women to destroy their own children living or desd@@GayleKing @ CNN

This seems right. A couple problems, though: 1) I suspect Obama is highly interested in maintaining his appeal and popularity; putting his thumb on the scale hurts that. 2) If he steps in and fails to stop Sanders, it *really* helps Trump.

You know where she's at... You can find her behind Weinstein with her lips attached to his butt.

Harvey Weinstein is still a monster.

Reading. Not watching TV. Currently reading two books: LEGACY OF ASHES BY TIM WEINSTEIN and THE AGE OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM BY SHOSHANA ZUBOFF. FRIGHTENING!

Hablando de películas, NO VEAN Una Guerra Brillante (The Current War) Co-producción de The Weinstein Company, retira de cines por el escándalo de Harvey W y que vuelven a estrenar ahora. No le den plata a ese cerdo.

This has nothing to do with comparing snoop to trump! Joe can explode rightfully so but there’s more blame than towards one person. True fact, gayle & Oprah have made a name for themselves by blasting black men! Why no discussion about their relationship with Weinstein/Epstein?

MSNBC and NBC News are the same guys who protected their own # METOO villians, yes? And protected shitheads like Matt Lauer and Weinstein? And have they exposed or broken anything about Epstein? Corporate crooks run this country. Even when your employees are truthful and caring...

Accused Weinstein/Cosby/Epstein did so without payment. That is bravery. What CF is doing is manipulative theft. I sincerely feel badly for him - he is so damaged. But he should talk about his own experience only. If he knows of criminal activity, he should reveal

But that would ruin their years of ignoring, withholding and rewriting evidence under Mueller and Weinstein.

OK, you do realize that Ashley Judd was a victim of Weinstein, and didn't say a word about it for over a decade, right? She stayed silent while dozens of other young actresses went through the same thing.

I don’t agree with any threats, but I believe @ GayleKing was projecting her friendship with Harvey Weinstein onto @ LisaLeslie and @ kobebryant. She went too hard, and it backfired. She should have never been delivering that line of questioning to begin with. It’s hypocritical.

Nobody said he is not guilty, but 9 years? He is not a rapist... how much you’ll give to Weinstein?

Weinstein's lawyer saying she'd never been sexually assaulted "because she had not put [herself] in that position" made me nauseous & I had to force myself to keep reading.

I am through with Gayle King no matter what @ Oprah # morningjoe @ JoeNBC or @ morningmika say. They deliberately tried to tarnish @ kobebryant hard work after death but want say shit about Harvey Weinstein or Oprah's spiritual advisor

All of this started NOT because of Gayle King, but this w. Black folk & resentment towards Oprah as a Mogul and her influence in Media doing hit-pieces on Black men in this Me-Too context, while being silent regarding her Hollywood white Jewish friends like Weinstein.

# POTUS & Govenors have an exclusive power of "Pardon" which I hope he uses in this case. It has nothing to do with your false allegation. Your husband pardoned thieves. Your corruption has never been matched, aided Harvey Weinstein.

Im gegensatz zu Portman, war McGowan zusammen mit Ashley Judd die ersten beiden Frauen, die die sexuellen Belästigungen von Weinstein öffentlich gemacht haben. Sie wurden dafür angefeindet, diffamiert, sie bekamen keine Aufträge und sogar Mirddrohungen.

Portman hat erst reagiert,als das movement voll im Rollen war und allen klar war, das die Anschuldigungen gegen Weinstein und Konsorten berechtigt waren. Sie hat sich so lange zurückgehalten,bis es öffentlicher Konsens war, bis dahin hat sie weiterhin von den Kontakten profitiert

He did not order anyone to do anything. The entire Roger Stone matter was the product of anti-Trumper Weinstein, telling CNN where to be so they could watch SWAT arrest a 70 year old man. He was expressing his opinion, like you did by tearing up the SOTU speech, a classless act

Both complicit, especially in the Weinstein case, because of their close affiliation with him. The point is treat them all with the same respect, or disrespect, and be done with it. Friends or not, they’re alleged predators, and deserve the same treatment.

When are journalists going after Hollywood for similar behavior. Weinstein was tip of iceberg in vile behavior. Pedophiles have long been rumored to be operating within those circles. Yes it horrifying and vile but where have the journos been in rooting it out here in America

Bloomberg is a mad racist. Why plump for him? Bernie has his flaws but would be reined in by the rest of his party. They're not as compliant as the GOP.

Been given her lack of statements on Weinstein, Epstein, et al. It’s why the Black community is so distrustful of media, and sending Black faces to do character assassinations is something we’re wary of! Because it happens, all the time.

It's just that I'm not gonna support anyone who supports or works with abusers like Chris brown, Dr Luke, harvey weinstein, etc

For @ MikeBloomberg to use @ BarackObama image and voice in his ads, didnt his campaign have to get Obamas permission? If yes, doesnt that mean Obama has already endorsed Bloomberg without having to announce it?

Of course she doesn't. She was sucking up to this racist mayor for donations to CAP. @ ZaidJilani remarks on the story all the time. Neera has no interest in holding powerful donors to acct bc she's corrupt af. Her and Hillary looked the other way with Weinstein. Wanted Libyas oil

In Ashley Judd's defense, try to imagine what having to endure Harvey Weinstein's nutless sack and mangina to catch your "big break" does to a fragile, or even a strong person's psyche. She may be a "nasty woman", but she had a lot of help getting to that point. pic.twitter.com/k3V5oqMKim

Sure until he brings up her ex employees! Do you even know her past? They even said so much in CNN! Nobody saying anything about it as they don’t consider her real! Just wait for it, listen it’s coming...!

That’s because people are in shock! But understand this: Oprah and Gayle have not said or done word one about Weinstein, or that so called faith healer Oprah touted that went to jail for sexual assault! But they killed Kobe, Cosby, and Michael Jackson! Pattern??

One final point: Point 5 is obviously conditional on whether Point 4 needs to happen.

@ ChuckieOnline play marques Houston song. Regardless is R-Kelly is in the song. People still watch kevin spacey films and Harvey Weinstein movies. Why ban the Black man only.

Like Harvey Weinstein

Normal have you read anything on how she treated her employees? Be real!

Hahaha suuurrreeee she is! Please then every story of abuse if her employees comes out and Americans will want to throw her in jail! I watched her speech last night and could only last two minutes! She doesn’t have it and she is a horrible boss too! Not Presidential!

I've been at work for twelve (12) minutes and I've already been in a brief shouting match with people defending Harvey Weinstein, I hate this place so much

Those already w/ Bernie probably aren't going to leave Bernie. The idea would be for Obama to unite behind a single non-Bernie candidate so the "moderate" vote doesn't continue to be split.

4) If, however, Bernie wins NV and SC despite Obama's endorsement, Obama should consider withdrawaling endorsement and getting whoever he endorsed to drop out of the race. 5) Give Bloomberg a chance from Super Tuesday on. 4/x

I agree with all of this

Prosecute Harvey Weinstein for extortion instead of rape. It’s easier to prove. - The Washington Post https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/11/prosecute-harvey-weinstein-extortion-instead-rape-its-easier-prove/ …

These are evenly divided among Democrats & Republicans; several are wrong. The left controls the media, promotes election fraud (opposes voter ID) & coddles prominent sexists (Weinstein, Clinton, Lauer, Epstein...). Fascists hate religion (competing ideology).

Like Weinstein? He knows how to get things done.

If Biden loses SC, he almost certainly drops out. So either way, it makes most sense for Obama to endorse someone after SC. If it's Biden, then Obama's endorsement will drive "Comeback kid" press coverage. If it's Buttigieg, especially if he overperforms in SC, then new race.

SHOWBIZ MINUTE: Jussie Smollett - Harvey Weinstein - 'Parasite' http://apne.ws/q99RyKq

But what would be the effect if Obama spoke out against Bernie? Are you sure it would not be the opposite of the intended one? Those who are intoxicated by confirmation bias might simply take it as a proof that their Bernie-or-nobody attitude is the right way forward.

2) Decide between Amy and Pete. Endorse whoever he thinks is best and then campaign vigorously for them in NV and SC. 3) Evaluate after SC. If it looks like the candidate he endorsed is positioned to beat Bernie, carry on. 3/x

At this point in the race, he should be endorsing Biden. I guess a Buttigieg endorsement could get Buttigieg the minority support he needs, but really Obama should probably wait until SC. If Biden wins SC, he probably has the delegate lead.

Could care less about Ashley Judd & her swollen face. Her & those defending her can fuck off! She remained silent on Weinstein for over 2 decades & continued to work with him. She’s a lying fraud. # greedRules

@ njburkett7 !! So that’s why I could feel objectivity in your coverage of Weinstein!

If you're a 50 something, male, married TV presenter, how come you get standing ovations and praise if you shag a 20 yr old guy you've known since he was 10? Yet would be the next Harvey Weinstein if it were a female?

Okay but Bong Joon Ho fighting Weinstein for wanting more action scenes and Chr*s Evans in Snowpiercer radiates the same energy as when Hayao Miyazaki sent the same man a samurai sword as a warning because he wanted to edit Princess Mononoke.

What are you talking about when did he help Weinstein? When he threatened to kill him? What’s your source? Any criticism of that sham of a trial should be celebrated.

She didn’t look like this a few weeks ago... or at least while she was talking about the Weinstein situation

McGowan, a woman who took money from Weinstein to cover up his behaviour to save her career allowing him to carry on allegedly abusing for years. A bit hypocritical of her.

Nice try ,many people say Weinstein and Trump assaulted more than 50 women and were friends .

This is a horror show. Weinstein, Epstein, this nightmare. All aided by a complicit set of structures designed to protect and enable the powerful.

I think they meant middle aged white guys who rigged the damn system in their favor for decades and those who were their loyal lap dogs. Look at Harvey Weinstein and Jeffery Epstein etc. https://twitter.com/HarvardBiz/status/1227489890092212227 …

1. This civility and decorum never seems to apply to how the dem party actually engages with corruption and nepotism. Hillary was close with weinstein, epstein, and trump for gods sake! 2. Weirdly it also never stops republicans from utterly thrashing you at every opportunity.

Stan Weinstein et Covel sont les seuls que j'ai lu plusieurs fois et que je relis encore... Le Covel, je le recommande, mais je me suis toujours demandé si en français il est aussi complet que la version US (658 pages, 3 sections, 28 chapitres, et des tonnes de sous sections)

Hell yeah! Just think, MJ settled ONCE for comprehensible reasons but people want to hang him higher. "It's an admission of his guilt!" Weinstein settled numerous times and nobody cares.

Impeachmentgate, pizzagate, russiagate, ukrainegate, epstein island, epstein ranch, harvey Weinstein, Anthony wiener. All democrats or dem crimes. And dont forget disney stopping by the island as well.....many CEOs corrupt.

Thinking specifically of the influence of Ann Sewill, Larry Gross, the Woochers, Michael Weinstein et al. They FUND these tenant groups.

Been listening to @ RonanFarrow podcast. I never want to watch # NBC again. They are just as culpable for the assaults as Weinstein and Lauer. Thank you Ronan for giving so many of us a voice.

Yeah, Harvey Weinstein I'm sure thinks the same. But truth be told, I don't expect much at all from someone like you. What's sad is that there are gay men allowing themselves to be played by someone like you. That's the tragedy. You're just another trashy straight.

Obama did not award the presidential medal of freedom to Anthony Weiner, Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby

Yes there are way more qualified directors that could do this movie justice but it’s not all about him. I just want to see a good squad movie regardless of the director. If was Harvey Weinstein type bad I would want him off the movie but not the whole movie to fail

I can’t stand his candidacy, but this is so stupid of you. It’s like making every actress that ever took a picture with Harvey Weinstein somehow guilty by association for his behavior, regardless of what they knew or didn’t know. Don’t do this cheap shit. It’s what Trumpers do.

For sure. But there are also horror stories, generally from women, in every industry. I have a few of my own. Hell, look at Weinstein. This isn’t new or unique to any industry, sadly.

Fully agree. Gayle King and Oprah Winfrey are showing their hypocrisy. They remain quiet about Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein - rapists. Despite the documented fact they were close friends with both men. Yet, Gayle felt fine sullying Kobe’s name in death. But fake photo.

Weinstein. Much for the scales of Justice. The GOP is defiling her right in front of our eyes, and there is not 1 thing any of us can do about it. Who's next? Somebody says something bad about Trump and they get arrested?

there's no right answer here. And thank you maybe I should have included trauma and especially generational trauma.

We all have the potential to be equally evil, but some of us choose not to dramatize that evil on others. Mrs. Clinton knew what # Weinstein # Epstein # Raniere # EdBuck # BillClinton were up to and yet she still took their money. She exploits shattered minds.

Trickle up economics works much better than trickle down... Wealthy folks don't collect wealth give it to people with no strings attached. That's generosity rather than charity

Gayle also displayed poor journalistic decorum when she questioned Ronan Farrow about possibly having an axe to grind regarding his Harvey Weinstein book. Her actions can be viewed as showing bias or favoritism towards certain individuals accused of assault.

To let you ALL in on the joke, Trump wrote the first 3 sentences last night, referring to Roger Stone. I added the last two sentences, twisting it to be about Weinstein instead. If you were abreast of the news, you'd have gotten the joke...

lrt reminds me that weinstein did to vampire academy. Iwas a terrible movie. but the writers/director said that the studio re-edited it and that what was released was not the movie they had written & filmed.

Oprah is on Very thin ice with blacks and I say this as a pretty much Life long fan. The Leaving Neverland interview, the Russell Simmons doc. And yes,why is she NOT talking to Weinstein or Epsteins victims? Throwing black men under the bus is a Great way to ruin your legacy,O.

My god just say Bernie had an incredible night. He won the popular vote in both contests and has momentum as we head to NV, SC, and beyond. Stop qualifying it!

Yes,it was real and mostly focussed on Weinstein but feminist sleazebags who are just clones of Weinstein with political and pr agenda turned it into a clustersf***k.

There is so much politics involved in the Oscars.. the academy members have to actually watch some of the films for a start. Part of the reason Weinstein was so successful/powerful was he was good at getting them to watch his films.. = more awards

I said for years: "I wish he'd killed me." I 100% believe that an accuser's evidence should be analyzed (contrary to the "believe all women" thing), and that's what's happening in court right now re: Weinstein. But this guy creating this story that sounds right in *his* mind

Weinstein - accused by over 100 women. Don't leave out that HUGE detail.

The party of Bill Clinton, Harvey Weinstein, Carlos Danger, war on cops, late term abortion talking about morals? Maybe you might want to try a different argument.

Its also refreshing that with Bernie I never have to wonder why he is in photos with Epstein, Trump, Weinstein, or other disgusting people. Bernie is a man that has been fighting for the same positions for decades, and now theyre the front runner for the presidential nomination

That’s the conclusion I came to and that is why I voted for her today in NH. I am far more left than she is but I am also a pragmatist. She can capture disillusioned Trump voters, both Republicans and Independents in my opinion. She’s optimistic and positive. I like her!
